EDK II Driver W riter's Guide for UEFI 2.3.1[DRAFT]
1 Introduction
1 Introduction
UEFI is a modular, extensible interface that abstracts the details of platform hardware from an
operating system (OS). It complements existing interfaces, helps manufacturers create OS-neutral add-
in products, and provides an efficient replacement for PC BIOS legacy option ROMs.

EDK II Driver W riter's Guide for UEFI 2.3.1[DRAFT]
1.1 Overview
1.1 Overview
This document is designed to aid in the development of UEFI Drivers using the EDK II open source
project as a development environment. The EDK II provides a crossplatform firmware development
environment for UEFI. UEFI Drivers are described in the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
Specification (hereafter referred to as the "UEFI Specification"
_
). There are different categories of UEFI
Drivers, and many variations of each category . This document provides basic information for the most
common categories of UEFI drivers. Many other driver designs are possible.
In addition, this document covers the design guidelines and recommendations for the different driver-
related UEFI Protocols, along with the design guidelines for PCI, USB, SCSI, A T A, Consoles, Serial Ports,
Graphics, Mass Storage, Network Interfaces and User Credentials.
Finally, this document discusses UEFI Driver porting considerations and UEFI Driver optimiz ation
techniques for Intel IA-32-
, Intel x64- and Intel(R) Itanium(R)-based platforms, as well as EFI Byte Code
(EBC) platform types supported by the UEFI Specification.
The UEFI Driver W riters Guide uses the names defined by the EDK II open source project when referring
to the various platform types.
IA32 -Intel IA-32 platforms
X64 -Intel(R) 64 platforms
IPF -Intel(R) Itanium(R)-based platforms
EBC -EFI Byte Code platforms
1.1.1 Assumptions
This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the following:
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Specification, V ersion 2.3.1.
The EDK II is an open-source build environment project that is under constant development. EDK II
not only provides the build environment, but also provides build tools and source code for firmware
and drivers.
Note: The EDK II project of TianoCore is under active development, often on a daily basis. Be sure to
use a validated release of UDK2010 for all UEFI Driver development.
The UDK2010 Developer's Kit, referred to in this guide as the UDK2010, contains EDK II validated
common-core sample code. The open-source UDK2010 is a stable build of the EDKII project and has
been validated on a variety of Intel platforms, operating systems and application software. The
open-source UDK2010 is available for download at www .tianocore.org
The UDK2010 supports UEFI Driver development using the following operating system environments:
Microsoft Windows*
, UNIX and like systems and MAC OS X (R). R efer to <http://www> .tianocore.org for a
complete list of current development operating systems.
The UDK2010 supports the development of UEFI Drivers using several families of compilers including
those from Microsoft*
, Intel and GCC. R efer to <http://www> .tianocore.org for a complete list of
currently supported compilers.

2 UEFI Driver Implementation Checklist
2 UEFI Driver Implementation Checklist
The following is a checklist for implementing good, conformant, and efficient UEFI Drivers. R eferences to
sections of the guide that apply to each of the items in the checklist are provided so a UEFI Driver
developer can easily determine the sections of the guide that apply to a specific UEFI Driver
development task. The terminology used in this checklist is introduced in Chapter 3.
When possible, copy an existing UEFI Driver with similar features and modify it to match the new UEFI
Driver requirements. Appendix B contains a table of UEFI Drivers and features that each implements to
help select an existing UEFI Driver.
Some UEFI drivers are ported from PC BIOS legacy option ROMs or EFI/UEFI Drivers based on previous
releases of the EFI/UEFI Specification. While porting a driver from one environment to another is often
done to save time and leverage resources, note that it requires careful attention to detail. Without a
complete understanding of the target environment, the final driver can have remnants of the previous
design that may degrade performance and functionality in the new environment.

2.1 Design and implementation of UEFI drivers
2.1 Design and implementation of UEFI drivers
The following lists the basic steps a driver writer should follow when designing and implementing a UEFI
driver. Note that this document assumes UEFI driver model drivers are being developed.
1. Determine the category of UEFI driver to be developed. The different categories are listed in T able 2,
below, and are described in more detail in Chapter 6 of this document.
Note: UEFI Drivers that follow the UEFI Driver Model are recommended because they enable faster
platform boot times.
2. Make sure the driver supports the unload service. This feature is strongly recommended for all
drivers. Section 7.6 describes the unload service.
3. Make sure the UEFI driver supports both the Component Name protocol and the Component Name2
protocol. It is strongly recommended that all drivers support both protocols.
4. Is the UEFI driver going to include configuration settings that the user can change? If so, the driver
must support HII functionality . Note that the HII functionality replaces the Driver Configuration
Protocol, which is now obsolete. See T able 2.
5. The UEFI driver must produce the Driver Diagnostics Protocols if the driver is going to support
testing See Chapter 13.
6. If the UEFI driver is a bus driver for a bus type that supports storage of UEFI drivers with the child
devices, the Bus Specific Driver Override Protocol must be implemented by the bus driver. See
Chapter 17 of this guide.
7. A UEFI driver might not need to call an Exit Boot Service event. However, if the UEFI driver is going to
require an Exit Boot Services event, then the driver must create an event of type Exit Boot Services.
When the driver initializ es, it creates the event, and when Exit Boot Services happens, the system
calls the function that the driver produces. See Chapter 7.
8. For runtime drivers, make sure the driver defines an event of type Set Virtual Address Map. This
allows the driver to know where the memory map is located once the OS takes control. See Chapter
7.
9. Identify the I/O-related protocols the driver needs to consume. Based on the list of consumed
protocols and the criteria for these protocol interfaces, determine how many instances of the Driver
Binding Protocol need to be produced. For example, a console driver might have multiple binding
protocols to allow for input from multiple devices. See Chapter 9.
10. Identify all I/O-related protocols that the driver binding model must produce. Once the I/O-related
protocols are known, make sure the driver creates a function with a single entry point for each
protocol.
11. Implement the driver's entry point. See Chapter 7.
12. Design the private context data structure. See Chapter 8.
13. Implement all the services listed in the supported section of the Driver Binding Protocol. See
Chapter 9. See T able 3.

Note: The device path protocol is a data structure protocol, not a function call with a callable entry
point. It is the UEFI driver's job to append the path of the devices it is controlling to the data structure.
In other words, as part of producing the I/O protocol for each device, the driver builds the device path
for that device.

Do not try to search the handle database specifically . Instead, allow the
supported section of the driver binding protocol to do this operation.
The supported section checks to see if the driver supports the device for the
specified controller handle. The supported section uses the controller handle
along with a partial device path, to check to see if the specific device is
supported, and returns supported, already started, or notsupported for each
device.
Use shell applications, such as the dh (dump handle database) command or the
drivers shell command.
The dh command returns a list of all devices on the system. The drivers command
returns a list of all drivers on the system. With the list of drivers, the dh -d
command can be used to list the handles which that driver supports.
Use the DMA-related services from the PCI I/O Protocol. See the PCI driver section
(Chapter 18) of this guide.
Always use PCI I/O Protocol services to access the PCI configuration header. Never
directly access I/O ports 0xCF8 or 0xCFC.
See the PCI driver section (Chapter 18) of this guide.
Always use PCI I/O Protocol services to access PCI I/O ports. Never use IN or OUT
instructions.
See the PCI driver section (Chapter 18) of this guide.
Use PCI I/O Protocol services to access PCI memory . Never use pointers to directly
access memory-mapped I/O resources on a bus.
See the PCI driver section (Chapter 18) of this guide.
EDK II does not support legacy INT type hooking interrupts. Instead, UEFI drivers
are expected to either perform block I/O, by which they must complete their I/O
operation and poll their devices as required to complete it, or they can create a
periodic timer event to get control and check the status of the devices under
management.
See the services section (Chapter 5) and the general driver guidelines section
(Chapter 4) of this guide for more detail.
Do not use hardware devices to perform calibrated stalls. Instead, use the Stall()
service for short delays that are typically less than 10 ms. Use one-shot timer
events for long delays that are typically greater than 10 ms. Use SetTimer() in
conjunction with CreateEvent() , or CreateEventEx( ), for longer delays. Do not use the
GetTime() service for delays in UEFI drivers. Use it only to retrieve information. See
the services section in this guide: Services that UEFI drivers commonly use.
Use the HII interface to accept keyboard input from the user. The HII engine
displays forms to the user in which the user can answer questions or provide
input. The forms themselves are defined in the VFR standard.
Note that console-related services, such as Simple T ext Input Protocol and Simple
T ext Output Protocol can be replaced with or supplemented by HII functionality
and forms.
Note that the Driver Configuration Protocol service is obsolete and has been
replaced with HII functionality .
Use the HII interface to display text to the user. The HII engine displays forms to
the user and allows querying of the user. The forms themselves are defined by the
VFR programming language and IFR specification.
Note that console-related services, such as Simple T ext Input Protocol and Simple
T ext Output Protocol, can be replaced with or supplemented by HII functionality

UEFI drivers should not try to reprogram a flash device. T ypically, a flash device is
reprogrammed by a standalone application, such as a UEFI utility .
The OS-present drivers should not make assumptions about the state of a
controller. It should not assume a UEFI driver touched the controller before the OS
was booted. If a specific state is required, then the driver can use an Exit Boot
Services event to put the controller into the required state. See Chapter 7.

UEFI employs several key concepts as cornerstones of understanding for UEFI Drivers. These concepts
are defined in the UEFI Specification. Programmers new to UEFI should find the following introduction to
a few of UEFI's key concepts helpful as they study the UEFI Specification.
The basic concepts covered in the following sections include:
Basic programming model
Objects managed by UEFI-conformant firmware
UEFI system table
Handle database
Protocols
UEFI images
Events
T ask priority levels
Device paths
UEFI driver binding model
Platform initializ ation
Boot manager and console management
EDK II libraries
As each concept is discussed, the related application programming interfaces (APIs) are identified
along with references to the related sections in the UEFI Specification.
One of the components available from the EDK II open source project and distributed with the UDK2010
releases is the UEFI Shell; a command line interface with useful commands for development and testing
of UEFI drivers and UEFI applications. The UEFI Shell also provides commands to help illustrate many of
the basic concepts described in the sections that follow . These useful UEFI Shell commands are
identified as each concept is introduced. The UEFI Shell is an open source project at
<http://www> .tianocore.org where documents providing details on all of the available commands can be
found.

3.1 Basic programming model
3.1 Basic programming model
Common questions about UEFI include:
How are programs in UEFI implemented?
What makes UEFI programming different from an operating system?
What makes UEFI different from other firmware environments?
In particular, what is the programming model for a UEFI Driver?
K ey points about writing UEFI-conformant drivers are that:
UEFI Drivers are relocatable PE/COFF images whose format is defined by the Microsoft Portable
Executable and Common Object File Format Specification.
UEFI Drivers may be compiled for any of the CPU architectures supported by the UEFI Specification.
UEFI Drivers run on a single CPU thread.
The driver support infrastructure does not extend beyond the boot processor.
Drivers sit above some interfaces (for example, bus abstractions) and below other interfaces: They
are both consumers and producers. The UEFI Specification defines the interfaces and they are
extensible.
Each driver is expected to cooperate with other drivers, other modules and the underlying core
services.
The communicating modules bind together to create stacks of cooperating drivers to accomplish
tasks.
Inter-module communication is enabled via interfaces known as protocols and via events.
T ables provided at invocation provide access to core services.
The operating environment is non-preemptive and polled. There are no tasks per se. Instead,
modules execute sequentially .
There is only one interrupt: the timer. This means that data structures accessed by both in-line
code and timer-driven code must take care to synchroniz e access to critical paths. This is
accomplished via privilege levels.

Some UEFI drivers may need to access environment variables, but most do not.
Rarely do UEFI drivers require the use of a monotonic counter, watchdog timer or realtime clock.
The UEFI system table provides access to all services provided by UEFI. The system table also provides
access to all the additional data structures that describe the configuration of the platform. Each of
these object types, and the services that provide access to them, are introduced in the following
sections.

3.3 UEFI system table
3.3 UEFI system table
The UEFI system table is the most important data structure in UEFI. From this one data structure, a UEFI
executable image can gain access to system configuration information and a rich collection of UEFI
services. These UEFI services include the following:
UEFI boot services
UEFI runtime services
Services provided by protocols
T wo of the data fields in the UEFI system table, UEFI boot services and UEFI runtime services, are
accessed through the UEFI boot services table and the UEFI runtime services table, respectively . The
number and type of services that are available from these two tables are fixed for each revision of the
UEFI Specification. The UEFI boot services and UEFI runtime services are defined in the UEFI
Specification. The specification also describes the common uses of these services by UEFI drivers.
Protocol services are groups of related functions and data fields that are named by a Globally Unique
Identifier (GUID; see Appendix A of the UEFI Specification). Protocol services are typically used to provide
software abstractions for devices such as consoles, mass storage devices and networks. They can also
be used to extend the number of generic services that are available in the platform.
Protocols are the basic building blocks that allow the functionality of UEFI firmware to be extended over
time. The UEFI Specification defines over 30 different protocols, and various implementations of UEFI
firmware. UEFI drivers may produce additional protocols to extend the functionality of a platform.

3.4 Handle database
3.4 Handle database
The handle database is composed of objects called handles and protocols. Handles are a collection of
one or more protocols and protocols are data structures named by a GUID. The data structure for a
protocol may contain data fields, services, both or none at all.
At reset, the Handle Database is empty . During platform initializ ation, the system firmware, UEFI
conformant drivers and UEFI applications create handles and attach one or more protocols to the
handles. Information in the handle database is "global" and accessible by any executable UEFI image.
The handle database is a list of UEFI handles and is the central repository for the objects maintained by
UEFI-based firmware. Each UEFI handle identified by a unique handle number is maintained by the
system firmware. A handle number provides a database "key" to an entry in the handle database. Each
entry in the handle database is a collection of one or more protocols. The types of protocols named by
a GUID attach to a UEFI handle and determine the handle type. A UEFI handle may represent
components like:
Executable images such as UEFI drivers and UEFI applications
Devices such as network controllers and hard drive partitions
UEFI services which are accessed as drivers such as EFI Decompress and the EBC Interpreter
The following figure shows a portion of the handle database. In addition to the handles and protocols, a
list of objects is associated with each protocol. The handle database uses this list to track which
agents are consuming which protocols. This information is critical to the operation of UEFI drivers. It is
what allows UEFI drivers to be safely loaded, started, stopped and unloaded without resource conflicts.

Description
This is the handle for the UEFI Driver image loaded into memory . It supports the
Loaded Image Protocol.
Supports all UEFI protocols. The most common protocols are the Driver Binding
Protocol, the two Component Name Protocols and the two Driver Diagnostics
Protocols.
This is a handle that has the attributes of both an Image Handle and a Driver Handle.
It is the handle for a UEFI Driver image loaded into memory . It supports the Loaded
Image Protocol, and it supports the UEFI Driver related protocols.
Some of the UEFI driver model-related services in the UEFI Specification use this term.
An agent is a UEFI component that can consume a protocol in the handle database.
An agent handle is a general term that can represent an image handle, a driver
handle or a driver image handle.
A controller handle represents a console or boot device that is present in the
platform. If the handle represents a physical device, then it must support the Device

Device Path Protocol. In addition, a device handle must support one or more
additional I/O protocols that are used to abstract access to that device. The list of I/O

3.5 GUIDs
3.5 GUIDs
A UEFI programming environment provides software services through the UEFI Boot Services T able, the
UEFI R untime Services T able, and Protocols installed into the handle database. Protocols are the
primary extension mechanism provided by the UEFI Specification. Protocols are named using a GUID.
A GUID is a unique 128-bit number that is a globally unique identifier (a universally unique identifier, or
UUID). Each time an image, protocol, device, or other item is defined in UEFI, a GUID must be generated
for that item. The example below shows the structure definition for an EFI

GUID in the EDK II along with
the definition of the GUID value for the EFI Driver Binding Protocol from the UEFI Specification.

}
TIP: New GUID values can be generated using the GUIDGEN utility shipped with Microsoft compilers, or
the *uuidgen command under Linux. Other GUID generation utilities may be found using internet
searches.
Protocol services are registered in the handle database using the GUID name of the Protocol and
Protocol services are discovered by looking up Protocols in the handle database using the GUID name
associated with the Protocol to perform the lookup operation.
UEFI fundamentally assumes that a specific GUID exposes a specific protocol interface (or other item).
Because a protocol is "named" by a GUID (a unique identifier), there should be no other protocols with
that same GUID. Be careful when creating protocols to define a new, unique GUID for a new protocol.
Put another way, the GUID forms a contract: If the UEFI Driver finds a protocol with a particular GUID, it
may assume that the contents of the protocol are as specified for that protocol. If the contents of the
protocol are different, the driver that published the protocol is assumed to be in error.
In some ways, GUIDs are can be viewed as contracts. If a UEFI Driver looks up a protocol with a certain
GUID, the structure under the GUID is well defined. If the GUID is duplicated, this 1:1 mapping breaks. If
a GUID is copied and applied to a new protocol, the users of the old protocol call the new protocol

expecting the old interfaces or vice versa. Either way, the results are never good.
Caution: There are improper practices to create new GUID values. For example, cutting and pasting an
existing GUID, hand-modifying an existing GUID, or
incrementing/decrementing fields in a GUID creates the opportunity to introduce a duplicate GUID.
These practices can cause catastrophic failures. T ypically, a system containing a duplicate GUID may
inadvertently find the new protocol and think that it is another protocol, which mostly likely crashes the
system. Another possible failure is a data-loss failure caused when a duplicated GUID is a data-handling
GUID (such as a disk I/O, file-system or NVRAM-handling GUID). Always use a GUID generator utility to
create new GUIDs.
TIP: Bugs caused by duplicate GUIDs are typically very difficult to root cause and many developers do
not check the GUID when debugging. If the root cause for a hang has not been found in a reasonable
amount of time, check to make sure the GUID for each relevant protocol is unique.

3.6 Protocols and handles
3.6 Protocols and handles
The extensible nature of UEFI is built, to a large degree, around protocols. Protocols serve to enable
communication between separately built modules, including drivers.
Drivers create protocols consisting of two parts. The body of a protocol is a C-style data structure
known as a protocol interface structure, or just "interface"
. The interface typically contains an
associated set of function pointers and data structures.
Every protocol has a GUID associated with it. The GUID serves as the name for the protocol. The GUID
also indicates the organiz ation of the data structure associated with the GUID. Note that the GUID is
not part of the data structure itself .
The example below shows a portion of the Component Named 2 Protocol definition from the UEFI Driver
Model chapter of the UEFI Specification. Notice that the protocol data structure contains two functions
and one data field.

Protocols are gathered into a single database. The database is not "flat.
"Instead, it allows protocols to
be grouped together. Each group is known as a handle, and the handle is also the data type that refers
to the group. The database is thus known as the handle database. Handles are allocated dynamically .
Protocols are not required to be unique in the system, but they must be unique on a handle. In other
words, a handle may not be associated with two protocols that have the same GUID.

3.6.1 Protocols are produced and consumed
3.6.1 Protocols are produced and consumed
Protocols enable inter-module communication in UEFI. T o enable this communication, one of the
modules must create or "produce" the protocol. Other modules (including drivers) may then use or
"consume" the protocol.
Drivers are both consumers and producers of protocols. For example, a UEFI Driver for a SCSI Host
Controller on a PCI bus consumes the PCI I/O Protocol and produces the SCSI Host Controller Protocols.
The initial producer of the protocol must "create" the protocol. The protocol structure must be allocated
from memory (allocated either statically in the program or via a memory allocation operation). The
protocol must then be initializ ed by filling in its contents. This almost always involves filling in the
function pointers declared in the protocol structure. In other words, to produce a protocol is to declare
its functionality and publish that functionality to the handle database (so other drivers can find and use
that declaration).
Although it is legal to store data in a protocol, this is strongly discouraged for data items that may change
over time. It is not a safe way to store dynamic data. Instead, functions that provide get/set operations
(as in object-oriented programming) are safer and more extensible. The producer then uses
InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() (as defined in the Boot Service chapter of the UEFI Specification) or
similar to install the protocol into the handle database and make the protocol available to others.
The consumer has a somewhat simpler task. The consumer looks up the protocol in the handle
database by GUID. With service protocols, for which there is only one instance in the entire handle
database, the consumer can use the LocateProtocol() service. For protocols that may be present on
multiple handles in the handle database, the LocateHandleBuffer() service can be used to locate the set of
handles that support a specified protocol. The consumer can then use the OpenProtocol() service to
lookup a protocol on a specific handle.
It is possible that the consumer is invoked before the producer. In this case, the consumer can request
it be notified when new instances of the protocol are created. This is accomplished using the
RegisterProtocolNotify() service.
Any UEFI image can use protocols during boot time. However, after ExitBootServices() is called, the handle
database is no longer available to the image.
A complete description of all the services used to manage the handle database and produce and
consume protocols appears in Chapter 5.

3.6.3 Protocols provided in addition to the UEFI Specification
3.6.3 Protocols provided in addition to the UEFI Specification
Not all protocols are defined in the UEFI Specification. For example, the EDK II, like other developer's
kits, includes additional protocols that are not part of the UEFI Specification. These additional protocols
are necessary to provide all of the functionality in a particular implementation but they are not defined
in the current UEFI Specification because they do not present an external interface-a requirement to
support booting of an OS or writing of a UEFI driver.
The creation of new protocols is how UEFI-based systems can be extended over time as new devices,
buses, and technologies are introduced.
The following are a few examples of protocols in the EDK II that are not part of the UEFI Specification:
Print 2 Protocol
MdeModulePkg/Include/Protocol/Print2.h
Deferred Procedure Call Protocol
MdeModulePkg/Include/Protocol/Dpc.h
VGA Mini Port Protocol
IntelFrameworkModulePkg/Include/Protocol/VgaMiniPort.h
UEFI Drivers and UEFI OS Loaders should not depend on these types of protocols because they are not
guaranteed to be present in every UEFI-conformant firmware implementation. UEFI Drivers and UEFI OS
Loaders should depend only on protocols defined in the current UEFI Specification and protocols
required by platform design guides (i.e. DIG64). The extensible nature of UEFI allows each platform to
design and add its own special protocols. Use these protocols to expand the capabilities of UEFI and
provide access to proprietary devices and interfaces congruent with the rest of the UEFI architecture.

3.6.4 Multiple protocol instances
3.6.4 Multiple protocol instances
Multiple protocols are installed on the same handle if the protocols provide services related to that one
handle. There are several handle types. The most common are image handles and device handles. For
example, if there are multiple I/O services for a single device that are abstracted through multiple
protocols, then multiple protocols must be installed onto the handle for that device.
A handle may have many protocols attached to it. However, it may have only one protocol of each GUID
name. In other words, a single handle may not produce more than one instance of any single protocol.
This prevents nondeterministic behavior about which instance would be consumed by a given request.
However, drivers may create multiple "instances" of a particular protocol and attach each instance to a
different handle. This scenario is the case with the PCI I/O Protocol, where the PCI bus driver installs a
PCI I/O Protocol instance for each PCI device. Each "instance" of the PCI I/O Protocol is configured with
data values unique to that PCI device, including the location and siz e of the UEFI-conformant Option
ROM (OpROM) image.
Each driver can install customiz ed versions of the same protocol (as long as it is not on the same
handle). For example, each UEFI driver produces the Component Name Protocols on its driver image
handle, yet when the Component Name Protocols' GetDriverName() function is called, each handle returns
the unique name of the driver that owns that image handle. The GetDriverName() function on the USB bus
driver handle returns "USB bus driver" for the English language, but the GetDriverName() function on the
PX E driver handle returns "PX E base code driver.

3.7 UEFI images
There are different types of UEFI images, but all UEFI images contain a PE/COFF header that defines the
format of the executable code. The PE/COFF image header follows the format defined by the Microsoft
Portable Executable and Common Object File Format Specification. The code can be for IA32, X 64, IPF, or
EBC. The header defines the processor type and the image type. R efer to the UEFI Image section of the
Overview chapter in the UEFI Specification for definitions of the processor types and the following three
image types:
UEFI applications
UEFI boot services drivers
UEFI runtime drivers
UEFI images are loaded and relocated into memory with the boot service LoadImage() .
There are several supported storage locations for UEFI images, including:
Expansion ROMs on a PCI card
System ROM or system flash
A media device such as a hard disk, floppy, CD-ROM, DVD, FLASH drive
LAN server
In general, UEFI images are not compiled and linked at a specific address. Instead, they are compiled
and linked such that relocation fix-ups are included in the UEFI image. This allows the UEFI image to be
placed anywhere in system memory . The Boot Service LoadImage() does the following:
Allocates memory for the image being loaded
Automatically applies the relocation fix-ups to the image

PROTOCOL contains information about the UEFI image that was loaded.
Because this information is published in the handle database, it is available to all UEFI components.
After a UEFI image is loaded with LoadImage() , the image can be started with a call to StartImage() . The
header for a UEFI image contains the address of the entry point called by StartImage() . The entry point
always receives the following two parameters:
The image handle of the UEFI image being started
A pointer to the UEFI system table
The image handle and pointer allow the UEFI image to:
Access all of the UEFI services that are available in the platform.
R etrieve information about where the UEFI image was loaded from and where in memory the image
was placed.
The operations performed by the UEFI image in its entry point vary depending on the type of UEFI image.

A UEFI image of type EFI IMAGE SUBSYSTEM EFI APPLICATION . This image is executed and

the EFI Boot Service ExitBootServices() to transfer control of the platform from the
firmware to an operating system.

EFI IMAGE SUBSYSTEM RUNTIME DRIVER . If this image returns EFI SUCCESS , then the image is
not unloaded. If the image returns an error code other than EFI
SUCCESS , then the
_
image is automatically unloaded from system memory . The ability to stay resident in
system memory is what differentiates a driver from an application. Because drivers
can stay resident in memory, they can provide services to other drivers,
applications, or an operating system. Only the services produced by runtime drivers
are allowed to persist past ExitBootServices() .
A driver that produces one or more protocols on one or more new service handles
and returns EFI
_
SUCCESS from its entry point.
A driver that does not create any handles and does not add any protocols to the
handle database. Instead, this type of driver performs some initializ ation operations
and returns an error code so the driver is unloaded from system memory .
A driver that creates one or physical controller handles that contain a Device Path
Protocol and a protocol that is a software abstraction for the I/O services provided
by a root bus produced by a core chipset. The most common root bridge driver is
one that creates handles for the PCI root bridges in the platform that support the
Device Path Protocol and the PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol.
A driver that follows the UEFI driver model described in the UEFI Driver Model chapter
of the UEFI Specification. This type of driver is fundamentally different from service
drivers, initializ ing drivers, and root bridge drivers because a driver that follows the
UEFI driver model is not allowed to touch hardware or produce device-related
services in the driver entry point. Instead, the driver entry point of a driver that
follows the UEFI driver model is allowed only to register a set of services that allow
the driver to be started and stopped at a later point in the system initializ ation
process.
A driver following the UEFI driver model. This type of driver produces one or more
driver handles or driver image handles by installing one or more instances of the

3.7.2 Drivers
UEFI drivers are different from UEFI applications in that, unless there is an error returned from the
driver's entry point, the driver stays resident in memory . The UEFI platform firmware, the boot manager,
and UEFI applications may load drivers.
3.7.2.1 Boot service drivers
Boot drivers are loaded into memory marked as EfiBootServicesCode , and they allocate their data
structures from memory marked as EfiBootServicesData . These memory types are converted to available
memory after ExitBootServices() is called.
3.7.2.2 Runtime drivers
R untime drivers are loaded in memory marked as EfiRuntimeServicesCode . They allocate their data
structures from memory marked as EfiRuntimeServicesData . These types of memory are preserved after
ExitBootServices() is called. This preservation allows runtime driver to provide services to an operating
system while the operating system is running. R untime drivers must publish an alternative calling
mechanism, because the UEFI handle database does not persist into OS runtime. The alternative calling
mechanism is application-specific.
The most common examples of UEFI runtime drivers are the Floating Point Software Assist driver
( FPSWA.efi ) and the network Universal Network Driver Interface (UNDI) driver. The EDK II does include an
UNDI driver. UEFI Drivers for Network Interface Controllers (NICs) are discussed in detail in Chapter 25.
Other runtime drivers are not common and are not discussed in this guide.
3.7.2.2.1 Be rigorous when implementing runtime drivers
Implementing and validating runtime drivers is much more difficult than implementing and validating
boot service drivers. The difficulties occur because UEFI supports the translation of runtime services
and runtime drivers from a physical addressing mode to a virtual addressing mode. For example, a
pointer might not have the same value in the physical address space as it might in the virtual address
space. Getting that translation, or mapping, correct is very difficult because if even a single pointer
translation is missed, the OS may crash or hang if the runtime driver is called and a code path that
accesses that pointer is used. Debugging runtime services provides by UEFI Drivers at OS runtime is
more difficult than debugging UEFI Drivers in the preboot environment. Since some code paths are
executed infrequently, careful code review and extensive validation of runtime drivers is strongly
recommended. Also, there are no utilities to perform such translations automatically . Each piece of data
and memory allocation must be inspected manually to determine if it needs to be adjusted. That in itself
can be an error-prone process. Additionally, if another driver writer tries to adjust the code, that writer
might not be aware of each piece of data or memory allocation that must adjusted.
There are best practices to help perform these translations. However, great care must be taken to
follow the recommended practices and UEFI requirements rigorously . Many of the requirements for
runtime drivers are listed in the UEFI Specification. Make sure they are well understood. Of particular
importance are the sections on runtime services, and specifically, virtual memory .

device periodically . The figure below shows the different types of events supported in UEFI, as well as

An event whose notification function is scheduled for execution whenever the event
goes from the waiting state to the signaled state.
A special type of signal event that is moved from the waiting state to the signaled

when ownership of the platform is transferred from the firmware to an operating
system. The event's notification function is scheduled for execution when
ExitBootServices() is called.

state when the UEFI runtime service SetVirtualAddressMap() is called. This call is the point
in time when the operating system is making a request for the runtime components of
UEFI to be converted from a physical addressing mode to a virtual addressing mode.
The operating system provides the map of virtual addresses to use. The event's
notification function is scheduled for execution when SetVirtualAddressMap() is called.
A type of signal event that is moved from the waiting state to the signaled state when
at least a specified amount of time has elapsed. Both periodic and one-shot timers are
supported. The event's notification function is scheduled for execution when a specific
amount of time has elapsed.
A type of timer event that is moved from the waiting state to the signaled state at a
specified frequency . The event's notification function is scheduled for execution when a
specific amount of time has elapsed.
A type of timer event that is moved from the waiting state to the signaled state after
the specified time period has elapsed. The event's notification function is scheduled
for execution when a specific amount of time has elapsed.
The following three elements are associated with every event:
The task priority level (TPL) of the event
A notification function
A notification context
The notification function for a wait event is executed when the state of the event is checked or when
the event is being waited upon. The notification function of a signal event is executed whenever the
event transitions from the waiting state to the signaled state.
The notification context is passed into the notification function each time the notification function is
executed. The TPL is the priority at which the notification function is executed. The four TPL levels that

3.8.1 Defining priority
Notification functions at higher priorities can interrupt the execution of notification functions executing
at a lower priority .
The mechanism for defining the priority (in which notification functions are executed), is used only when
more than one event is in the signaled state at the same time. In these cases, the notification function
that has been registered with the higher priority is executed first.

3.8.2 Creating locks
3.8.2 Creating locks
It is possible for the code in normal context and the code in interrupt context (i.e. notification functions)
to access the same data structure. This is because UEFI does support a single timer interrupt. This
access can cause issues if the updates to a shared data structure are not atomic. A UEFI application or
UEFI driver that wants to guarantee exclusive access to a shared data structure can temporarily raise
the task priority level to prevent simultaneous access from both normal context and interrupt context. A
lock can be created by temporarily raising the task priority level to TPL
HIGH
LEVEL . This level blocks even
_
_
the one timer interrupt. However, care must be taken to minimiz e the amount of time that the system
executes at TPL
HIGH
_
_
LEVEL . All timer-based events are blocked during this time and any driver requiring
periodic access to a device is prevented from accessing its device. See the Boot Services chapter of the
UEFI Specification for more information on T ask Priority Levels and Section 5.1.4 of this guide for
examples on how T ask Priority Levels can be used to create and manage locks.

3.8.3 Using callbacks
3.8.3 Using callbacks
The calls to create an event take two important parameters: the callback and the parameter pointer.
The callback function is invoked when the event occurs. Using callbacks appropriately is not difficult-as
long as the following rules are followed:
The parameter pointer can point to any static (not on the stack) structure. The parameter pointer is
used to provide state information for the event invocation. The parameter pointer is particularly
useful if multiple events must be handled by the same callback.
The callback function, when invoked, may only assume its priority level, its parameter pointer, and
that it has a stack. It must derive all context from the parameter pointer and the static data left in
its module. This makes writing callbacks somewhat more challenging than normal driver code.
3.8.3.1 Debugging callbacks
Debugging callbacks is a little like debugging interrupt handlers in that one is not always sure when a
callback is invoked. Most normal debugging facilities function as expected in callbacks.
There can be a temptation to write one's driver as a series of callbacks. This is not recommended since
normal code is easier to debug, and managing a large number of the context structures addressed by
parameter pointers becomes difficult to maintain.
TIP: Minimiz e the use of callbacks. Only use a callback when an operation cannot be implemented as
part of UEFI Driver initializ ation or through a protocol services provided by the UEFI Driver.

3.9 UEFI device paths
3.9 UEFI device paths
UEFI defines a Device Path Protocol that is attached to device handles in the handle database. The
Device Path Protocol helps operating systems and their loaders identify the hardware that a device
handle represents.
The Device Path Protocol provides a unique name for each physical device in a system. The collection of
Device Path Protocols for the physical devices managed by UEFI-based firmware is called a "name
"
space.
Modern operating systems tend to use ACPI and industry standard buses to produce a name space
while the operating system is running. However, the ACPI name space is difficult to parse, and it would
greatly increase the siz e and complexity of system firmware to carry an ACPI name space parser.
Instead, UEFI uses aspects of the ACPI name space that do not require an ACPI name space parser.
This compromise keeps the siz e and complexity of system firmware to a minimum. It also provides a way
for the operating system to create a mapping from UEFI device paths to the operating system's name
space.
A device path is a data structure that is composed of one or more device path nodes. Every device path
node contains a standard header that includes the node's type, subtype, and length. This standard
header allows a parser of a device path to hop from one node to the next without having to understand
every type of node that may be present in the system.
The following two examples show the declaration of the PCI device path node which combined the
generic UEFI Device Path Header with the PCI-device-specific fields Function and Device.
Example 3-Device Path Header
/**
**/
This protocol can be used on any device handle to obtain generic path/location information concerning the physical device or
logical device. If the handle does not logically map to a physical device, the handle may not necessarily support the device
path protocol. The device path describes the location of the device the handle is for. The size of the Device Path can be dete
rmined from the structures that make up the Device Path.

Used to describe devices on industry-standard buses that are directly accessible

mapped devices and devices on PCI buses and PC card buses.
Used to describe devices whose enumeration is not described in an industry-
standard fashion. This type of device path is used to describe devices such as PCI
root bridges and ISA devices. These device path nodes contain HID, CID, and UID
fields that must match the HID, CID, and UID values that are present in the
platform's ACPI tables.
Used to describe devices on industry-standard buses that are not directly
accessible through processor memory or processor I/O cycles. These devices are
accessed by the processor through one or more hardware bridge devices that
translate one industrystandard bus type to another industry-standard bus type.
This type of device path is used to describe devices such as SCSI, Fibre Channel,
1394, USB, I2O, InfiniBand(R), UAR T s, and network agents.
Hard disk, CD-ROM, and file paths in a file system that supports multiple directory
levels.
Used to describe a device that has a type that follows the BIOS Boot Specification,
such as floppy drives, hard disks, CD-ROMs, PCMCIA devices, USB devices, network
devices, and bootstrap entry vector (BEV) devices. These device path nodes are
used only in a platform that supports BIOS INT services.

Each of the device path node types also supports a vendor-defined node that is the extensibility
mechanism for device paths. As new devices, bus types, and technologies are introduced into
platforms, new device path nodes types may have to be created. The vendor-defined nodes use a GUID
to distinguish new device path nodes.
Careful design is required when choosing the data fields used in the definition of a new device path
node. As long as a device is not physically moved from one location in a platform to another location,
the device path must not change across platform boots or if there are system configuration changes in
other parts of the platform. For example, the PCI device path node only contains a Device and a
Function field. It does not contain a Bus field, because the addition of a device with a PCI-to-PCI bridge
may modify the bus numbers of other devices in the platform.
Instead, the device path for a PCI device is described with one or more PCI device path nodes that
describe the path from the PCI root bridge, through z ero or more PCI-toPCI bridges, and finally the
target PCI device.
The UEFI Shell is able to display a device path on a console as a string. The conversion of device path
nodes to printable strings is defined in the EFI Device Path Display Format Overview section of the UEFI
Specification. This optional feature allows developers to view device paths in a readable form using the
UEFI shell. The UEFI Shell also provides a method to perform a hex dump of a device path.
The example below shows some example device paths. These device paths show standard and
extended ACPI device path nodes being used for a PCI root bridge and an ISA floppy controller. PCI
device path nodes are used for PCI-to-PCI bridges, PCI video controllers, PCI IDE controllers, and PCI-to-
LPC bridges. Finally, IDE messaging device path nodes are used to describe an IDE hard disk, and media
device path nodes are used to describe a partition on an IDE hard disk.

3.9.1 How drivers use device paths
3.9.1 How drivers use device paths
UEFI drivers that manage physical devices must be aware of device paths. When possible, UEFI drivers
treat device paths as data structures. In general, UEFI Drivers are not required to parse or understand
the beginning of the device path. They usually only need to understand the device path node
associated with the specific controller the UEFI Driver is managing and, potentially, the device path
node associated with child controllers the UEFI Driver may generate by appending a new device path
node to the end of the device path from the parent controller.
R oot bridge drivers are required only to produce the device paths for the root bridges, which
typically contain only a single ACPI device path node.
For a child device, bus drivers usually just append a single device path node to that of the parent
device. The bus drivers should not parse the contents of the parent device path. Instead, a bus
driver appends the one device path node that it is required to understand to the device path of the
parent device.
For example, consider a SCSI Bus Driver that produces child handles for the mass storage devices on a
SCSI channel. This UEFI Driver builds a device path for each mass storage device. The device path is
constructed by appending a SCSI device path node to the device path of the SCSI channel. The SCSI
device path node simply contains the Physical Unit Number (PUN) and Logical Unit Number (L UN) of the
SCSI mass storage device.
The mechanism described above allows the construction of device paths to be a distributed process.
The bus drivers at each level of the system hierarchy are required only to understand the device path
nodes for their child devices. Bus drivers understand their local view of the device path, and a group of
bus drivers from each level of the system bus hierarchy work together to produce complete device
paths for the console and boot devices that are used to install and boot operating systems.
There are a number of functions in the EFI Device Path Utilities Protocol defined by the UEFI
Specification to help manage device paths. The MdePkg in the EDK II also provides a Device Path Library
with many useful functions and macros to manage device paths.

3.9.2 IPF Considerations for device path data structures
3.9.2 IPF Considerations for device path data structures
Individual device paths nodes may be any length, and each device path node in a complete device path
starts immediately after the previous device path node. This means that device path nodes inside of a
full device path may not start on a naturally aligned boundary . This can cause problems for CPU
architectures that do not support unaligned memory accesses such as IPF . A device path node that is
not a multiple of 8 bytes in length may cause a device path node that follows to be unaligned.
Implementing source code that manages device paths requires some special techniques to guarantee
that the source code is portable to all the CPU architectures supported by the UEFI Specification.
TIP: Be careful when using device paths. Make sure an alignment fault is not generated.
See Chapter 4 in this guide for more information about architecture-specific considerations. R efer to

passed into the Start() service. The protocol(s) installed by the device driver use the I/O services that
are provided by the bus I/O protocol that is installed on the controller handle. For example, a device
driver for a USB device uses the service of the USB I/O Protocol, and a device driver for a PCI controller
uses the services of the PCI I/O Protocol. In other words, the PCI I/O Protocol is consumed by a driver for
a PCI option ROM card. This process is called "consuming the bus I/O abstraction.

The fundamental definition of a UEFI device driver is that it does not create any child handles. This
difference distinguishes a device driver from a bus driver.
The definition of a device driver can be confusing because it is often necessary to write a driver that
creates child handles. This necessity makes the driver a bus driver by definition, even though the driver
may not be managing a hardware bus in the classical sense (such as a PCI, SCSI, USB, or Fibre Channel
bus).
Even though a device driver does not create child handles, the device managed by the device driver
could still become a "parent.
" The protocol(s) produced by a device driver on a controller handle may be
consumed by a bus driver that produces child handles. In this case, the controller handle that is
managed by a device driver is a parent controller. This scenario happens quite often.

3.10.2 Bus driver
3.10.2 Bus driver
A bus driver is nearly identical to a device driver except that a bus driver creates child handles. This
capability leads to several added features and responsibilities for a bus driver that are addressed in
detail throughout this document. For example, device drivers do not need to concern themselves with
searching the bus.
Just as with a device driver, the Start() function of a bus driver consumes the parent bus I/O
abstraction(s) and produces new I/O abstractions in the form of protocols. For example, the PCI bus
driver consumes the services of the
EFI
PCI
ROOT
BRIDGE
IO
PROTOCOL and uses these services to scan a PCI bus for PCI controllers. Each time a PCI
_
_
_
_
_
controller is found, a child handle is created and the
EFI
PCI
IO
PROTOCOL is installed on the child handle. The services of the EFI
_
_
_
PCI
IO
_
_
_
PROTOCOL are implemented
using the services of the EFI
PCI
ROOT
BRIDGE
IO
_
_
_
_
_
PROTOCOL
As a second example, the USB bus driver uses the services of the EFI
USB2
HC
_
_
_
PROTOCOL to discover and
create child handles that support the EFI
USB
IO
_
_
_
PROTOCOL for each USB device on the USB bus. The
services of the EFI
USB
IO
_
_
_
PROTOCOL are implemented using the services of the EFI
USB2
HC
_
_
_
PROTOCOL .
The following are the main objectives of the bus driver:
Initializ e the bus controller.
Determine how many children to create. For example, the PCI bus driver may discover and
enumerate all PCI devices on the bus or only a single PCI device that is being used to boot. How a
bus driver handles this step creates
a basic subdivision in the types of bus drivers. A bus driver can do one of the following:
Create handles for all child controllers on the first call to Start().
Allow the handles for the child controllers to be created across multiple calls to Start().
A bus driver that creates child handles across multiple Start() calls is very useful because it may
reduce the platform boot time. It allows a few child handles, or even a single child handle, to be
created across multiple calls to Start(). On buses that take a long time to enumerate their children
(for example, SCSI and Fibre Channel), multiple calls to Start() can save a large amount of time when
booting a platform.
Allocate resources and create a child handle in the UEFI handle database for one or more child
controllers.
Install an I/O protocol on the child handle that abstracts the I/O operations that the controller
supports (such as the PCI I/O Protocol or the USB I/O Protocol).
If the child handle represents a physical device, then install a Device Path Protocol (see the UEFI
Specification).
Load drivers from option ROMs, if present. The PCI bus driver is currently the only bus driver that
loads from option ROMs.
Some common examples of UEFI bus drivers include:
PCI Bus Driver : Creates a child handle for PCI controllers, either directly attached to a PCI R oot Bridge,

3.14 UEFI Driver Model Connection Process
3.14 UEFI Driver Model Connection Process
All UEFI Drivers that adhere to the UEFI Driver Model follow the same basic procedure. When the driver is
loaded, it installs a Driver Binding Protocol on the image handle from which it was loaded. It may also
update a pointer to the Unload() service of the Loaded Image Protocol and install the Component Name
2 Protocol and the Component Name Protocol, if needed, so its name is visible to any operator. The
UEFI Driver then exits from the entry point with a return status of EFI
_
SUCCESS , leaving the UEFI Driver
resident in system memory .
The Driver Binding Protocol provides a version number and the following three services:
Supported()
Start()
Stop()
The Driver Binding Protocol is available on the driver's image handle after the entry point is exited. Later
on when the system is "connecting" drivers to devices, the driver's Driver Binding Protocol Supported()
service is called.
The Supported() service is passed a controller handle. The Supported() function quickly examines the
controller handle to see if it represents a device that the driver knows how to manage. If so, it returns
EFI
_
SUCCESS . The system then starts the driver by calling the driver's Start() service, passing in the
supported controller handle. The driver can later be disconnected from a controller handle by calling
the Stop() service.
A platform connects the devices in a platform with the drivers available in the platform. This connection
process appears complex at first, but as the process continues, it becomes evident that the same
basic procedure is used over and over again to accomplish the complex task. This description does not
go into all the details of the connection process but explains enough that the role of various drivers in
the connection process can be understood. This knowledge is fundamental to designing new UEFI
Drivers.
The UEFI boot service ConnectController() demonstrates the flexibility of the UEFI Driver Model. The UEFI
Shell command connect directly exposes much of the functionality of this boot service and provides a
convenient way to explore the flexibility and control offered by ConnectController() .

3.14.1 ConnectController()
In practice, this sorting means that a PCI adapter, for example, that does
not have a UEFI driver in its PCI Option ROM is managed by the driver with
the highest V ersion number.
Phase two of the connection process checks each driver in the ordered list to see if it supports the
controller. This check calls the Supported() service of the driver's Driver Binding Protocol and passes in
the ControllerHandle and the R emainingDevicePath. If successful, the Start() service calls the Driver
Binding Protocol and passes in the ControllerHandle and R emainingDevicePath. Each driver in the list is
given an opportunity to connect, even if a prior driver connected successfully . However, if a driver with
higher priority had already connected and opened the parent I/O protocol with exclusive access, the
other drivers would not be able to connect if they also require exclusive access to the parent I/O
protocol.
Use this type of connection process because the order in which drivers are installed into the handle
database is not deterministic. Drivers can be unloaded and reloaded later, which changes the order of
the drivers in the handle database.
These precedent rules assume that the relevant drivers to be considered are loaded into memory . This
case may not be true for all systems. Large systems, for example, may limit "bootable" devices to a
subset of the total number of devices in the system.
The ConnectController() function can be called several times during the UEFI initializ ation. Use it to connect
consoles, devices required to load drivers from the driver list, and to connect devices required for the
boot options to be processed by the boot manager.

The following is an interesting use case that tests these precedence rules. Assume that the following

Adapter A: UEFI driver V ersion 0x10
Adapter B: UEFI driver V ersion 0x11
Adapter C: No UEFI driver
These three adapters have UEFI drivers in the option ROM as defined below . When UEFI drivers connect,
the drivers control the devices as follows:
UEFI driver V ersion 0x10 manages Adapter A.
UEFI driver V ersion 0x11 manages Adapter B and Adapter C.
If the UEFI driver version 0x12 is soft loaded through the UEFI Shell, nothing changes until the existing
drivers are disconnected and a reconnect is performed. This reconnection can be done in a variety of
ways but the UEFI Shell command reconnect r is the easiest.
The drivers now control the devices as follows:
UEFI driver V ersion 0x10 manages Adapter A.
UEFI driver V ersion 0x11 manages Adapter B.
UEFI driver V ersion 0x12 manages Adapter C.
An IHV can override this logic by implementing the Driver Family Override Protocol.

3.15.1 Connecting PCI R oot Bridges
3.15.1 Connecting PCI Root Bridges
During UEFI-conformant firmware initializ ation by the platform, the system typically uses the service
LoadImage() to load a root bridge driver for the root device. One common example is a PCI root bridge
driver.
Like all drivers, as it loads, UEFI firmware creates a handle in the handle database and attaches an
instance of the EFI
LOADED
IMAGE
_
_
_
PROTOCOL with the unique image information for the PCI root bridge driver.
Because this driver is the system root driver, it does not follow the UEFI Driver Model. Instead, it
immediately uses its knowledge about the platform architecture to create handles for each PCI root
bridge
As viewed using the dh UEFI Shell command below, a portion of the handle database shows a single PCI
root bridge. Some platforms, such as data center servers, will have more than one PCI root bridge.
A PCI root bridge driver installs the EFI

PROTOCOL and an EFI

handle. By not installing the Driver Binding
Protocol, the PCI root bridge prevents itself from being disconnected or reconnected later on. For
example, the handle database as viewed with the dh UEFI Shell command might look like the following
after the PCI root bridge driver is loaded and executed.
This example shows an image handle that is a single controller handle with a PCI R oot Bridge I/O
Protocol and the Device Path Protocol.

3.15.2 Connecting the PCI bus
3.15.2 Connecting the PCI bus
Platform initializ ation continues by loading the PCI bus driver. As the driver's entry point is executed, the
PCI bus driver installs the Driver Binding Protocol and potentially the Component Name Protocols.
For example, the handle database as viewed with the dh UEFI Shell command might look like the
following after the PCI bus driver is loaded and started. It contains one new driver image handle with the
Loaded Image Protocol, Driver Binding Protocol, and Component Name2 Protocol. Because this driver
does follow the UEFI Driver Model, no new controller handles are produced when the driver is loaded
and started. They are not produced until the driver is connected.
14: Image(PciBus) Driver Binding ComponentName
...
...
Later in the platform initializ ation process, UEFI-conformant firmware uses ConnectController() to attempt
to connect the PCI root bridge controller(s) (handle #14 hex, as shown in the example above). The
system has several priority rules for determining what driver to try first, but in this case it searches the
handle database for driver handles (handles with the Driver Binding Protocol). The search finds handle
# 14 and call the Driver Binding Protocol Supported() service, passing in controller handle #14. The PCI
bus driver requires the Device Path Protocol and PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol to be started, so the
Supported() service returns EFI
_
SUCCESS when those two protocols are found on handle #14 After receiving
EFI
_
SUCCESS from the Supported() service, ConnectController() then calls the Driver Binding Protocol Start()
service with the same controller handle #14.
Due to the PCI Bus Driver, the Start() service uses the PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol functions to
enumerate the PCI bus and discover all PCI devices. For each PCI device/function that the PCI bus driver
discovers, it creates a child handle and installs an instance of the PCI I/O Protocol on the handle. The
handle is registered in the handle database as a "child" of the PCI root bridge controller.
The PCI bus driver also copies the device path from the parent PCI root bridge device handle and
appends a new PCI device path node Pci(Dev|Func). In cases where the PCI bus driver discovers a PCI-to-
PCI bridge, the devices below the bridge are added as children to the bridge. In these cases, extra PCI
device path nodes are added for each PCI-to-PCI bridge between the PCI root bridge and the PCI device.
For example, the handle database as viewed with the dh UEFI Shell command might look like the
following after the PCI bus driver is connected to the PCI root bridge. It shows that:
Nine PCI devices were discovered.
The PCI device on handle #1B has an option ROM with a UEFI driver.
That UEFI driver was loaded and executed and is shown as handle #1C.
Also notice that a single PCI card may have several UEFI handles if they have multiple PCI functions.

3.15.3 Connecting consoles
At this point during the platform initializ ation, the firmware has not initializ ed or configured a "console"
device that allows user input. This absence is often because a PCI device, waits for the PCI bus driver to
provide device handles for the console(s).
Most UEFI conformant platforms follow a console connection strategy to connect the consoles in a
manner consistent with that of the platform. This ensures that the platform is able to display messages
to all of the selected consoles through the standard UEFI mechanisms. Initially, this includes platform
initializ ation and informational screens, and later (during setup), HII functionality and forms. Prior to this
point, platform messages, if any, are conveyed through platform-specific methods.
Note: During initializ ation, the platform needs to connect console devices to the driver. HII functionality
is about displaying configurable information to the user, which happens after consoles are initializ ed
and after an HII compatible setup engine is invoked. UEFI Drivers should never directly access console
devices except for the few UEFI driver related services that explicitly allow user interaction. In most
cases, UEFI drivers use HII infrastructure to present information to users.

3.15.5 Console variables
3.15.5 Console variables
After loading these drivers in the handle database, the platform can connect the console devices that
the user has selected. The device paths for these consoles are stored in the ConIn, ConOut, and ErrOut
global UEFI variables (see the Boot Manager chapter of the UEFI Specification). For the purpose of this
example, the variables have the following device paths:
ErrOut = Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(1|1)/Uart(9600N81)/
VenMsg(Vt100+);Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(4|0)
ConOut = Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(1|1)/Uart(9600N81)/
VenMsg(Vt100+);Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(4|0)
ConIn = Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(1|1)/Uart(9600N81)/
VenMsg(Vt100+)
Note the following:
The ErrOut and ConOut variables are multi-instance device paths separated by semicolon (;)
indicating that the EFI output is mirrored on two different console devices. The mirroring is
performed when the ConSplitterDxe driver is connected. In this example, the two devices are a serial
terminal and a PCI video controller.
The ConIn variable contains a device path to a serial terminal.
The ErrOut variable is typically the same as the ConOut variable, but could be redirected to different
set of devices. It is important to check how this UEFI variable is configured when developing UEFI
drivers because the debug messages from a UEFI Driver are typically directed to the console
device(s) specified by ErrOut.ErrOut may not specify the same devices as ConOut
In this example, the two devices are a serial terminal and a PCI video controller. The EDK II provides the
DebugLib which is a library that provides services such as DEBUG() and ASSERT() that are used generate
debug messages.

3.15.6 ConIn
3.15.6 ConIn
The platform connects the console devices using the device paths from the ConIn, ConOut, and ErrOut
global UEFI variables. The ConIn connection process is discussed first.
ConIn = Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(1|1)/Uart(9600 N81)/ VenMsg(Vt100+)
The UEFI connection process searches for the device in the handle database having a device path that
most closely matches the following.
Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(1|1)/Uart(9600 N81)/VenMsg(Vt100+)
It finds handle 17 as the closest match. The portion of the device path that did not match ( Uart(9600
N81)/VenMsg(Vt100+) ) is called the remaining device path.
17: PciIo DevPath (Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(1|1))
UEFI calls ConnectController() , passing in handle 17 and the remaining device path. The connection code
constructs a list of all the drivers in the system and calls each driver, passing handle 17 and the
remaining device path into the Supported() service. The only driver installed in the handle database that
returns EFI
SUCCESS for this device handle is handle 30:
_
30: Image(PciSerialDxe) DriverBinding ComponentName2 ComponentName
After ConnectController() finds a driver that supports handle 17, it passes device handle 17 and the
remaining device path Uart(9600 N81)/ VenMsg(Vt100+) into the serial driver's Start() service. The serial driver
opens the PCI I/O Protocol on handle 17 and create a new child handle. The following is installed onto
the new child handle:
EFI
SERIAL
IO
_
_
_
PROTOCOL (defined in the Console Support chapter of the UEFI Specification)
EFI
DEVICE
PATH

_
_

The device path for the child handle is generated by making a copy of the device path from the parent
and appending the serial device path node Uart(9600 N81) . Handle 3B, shown below, is the new child
handle.
3B: SerialIo DevPath (Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(1|1)/Uart(9600 N81))
That first call to ConnectController() has now been completed, but the Device Path Protocol on handle 3B
does not completely match the ConIn device path, so the connection process is repeated. This time the
closest match for 'Acpi(HWP0002,0)/Pci(1|1)/Uart(9600 N81)/V enMsg(Vt100+)' is the newly created
device handle 3B. Now the remaining device path is 'V enMsg(Vt100+)'
. The search for a driver that
supports handle 3B finds the terminal driver, returning 'EFI
_
SUCCESS' from the 'Supported()' service.

remaining device path that was passed into the Start() service. Handle 3C, shown below, is the new

3.15.6 ConIn
At this point, the process still has not completely matched the ConIn device path, so the connection
process is repeated again. This time there is an exact match for Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(1|1)/Uart(9600
N81)/VenMsg(Vt100+) with the newly created child handle 3C. The search for a driver that supports this
controller results in two driver handles that return EFI
_
SUCCESS to the Supported() service. The two
driver handles are from the platform console management driver:
32: Image(ConPlatformDxe) Driver Binding ComponentName2 ComponentName
33: Driver Binding ComponentName2 ComponentName
Driver 32 installs a ConOut T ag GUID on the handle if the device path is listed in the ConOut global UEFI
variable. In this example, this case is true. Driver 32 also installs a StdErr T ag GUID on the handle if the
device path is listed in the ErrOut global UEFI variable. This case is also true in the following example.
Therefore, handle 3C has two new protocols on it: ConOut and StdErr .
3C: TxtInEx Txtin Txtout ConOut StdErr DevPath (Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(1|1)/Uart(9600 N81)/ VenMsg(Vt100+))
Driver 33 installs a ConIn T ag GUID on the handle if the device path is listed in the ConIn global UEFI
variable (which it does because the connection process started that way), so handle 3C has the ConIn
protocol attached.
3C: TxtinEx Txtin Txtout ConIn ConOut StdErr DevPath (Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(1|1)/Uart(9600 N81)/VenMsg(Vt100+))
UEFI uses these three protocols (ConIn, ConOut, and StdErr) to mark devices in the platform, which
have been selected by the user as ConIn, ConOut, and StdErr. These protocols are actually T ag GUIDs
without any services or data.
There are three other driver handles that return EFI
_
SUCCESS from the Supported() service. These driver
handles are from the console splitter drivers for the ConIn, ConOut, and StdErr devices in the system.
There is a fourth console splitter driver handle (which is not used on this handle) for devices that
support the Simple Pointer Protocol. The three driver handles are listed below :

primary console input device, the primary console output device, and the primary standard error device.
38: TxtinEx TxtIn SimplePointer AbsolutePointer

The console splitter driver's Supported() service for handle 34 examines the handle 3C for a ConIn

SUCCESS . The Start() service then opens the ConIn protocol on
handle 3C such that the primary console input device handle 38 becomes a child controller and starts

3.15.7 ConOut
3.15.7 ConOut
As with ConIn, firmware connects the ConOut devices using the device paths in the ConOut global UEFI
variable. If ConIn was not complicated enough, the ConOut global UEFI device path in this example is a
compound device path and indicates that the ConOut device is being mirrored with the console splitter
driver to two separate devices.
ConOut = Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(1|1)/Uart(9600 N81)/VenMsg(Vt100+);Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(4|0)
The UEFI connection process searches the handle database for a device path that matches the first
device path in the ConOut variable:
Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(1|1)/Uart(9600 N81)/VenMsg(Vt100+)`
Luckily, the device path already exists on handle 3C in its entirety thanks to the connection work done
for ConIn.
3C: Txtin Txtout ConIn ConOut StdErr DevPath
(Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(1|1)/Uart(9600 N81)/VenMsg(Vt100+))
UEFI performs a ConnectController() on handle 3C. Because this step was previously done with ConIn,
there is nothing more to be done here.
The connection process has not yet been completed for ConOut because the device path is a
compound device path and a second device needs to be connected:
Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(4|0)
The UEFI connection process searches the handle database for a device path that matches
Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(4|0). The device path already exists in its entirety on handle 1C and was
created by the PCI bus driver when it started and exposed the PCI devices.
1C: PciIo DevPath (Acpi(HWP0002,0,PNP0A03)/Pci(4|0))
UEFI now performs a ConnectController() on handle 1C. Note that the device path is a complete match, so
there is no remaining device path to pass in this time. ConnectController() constructs the prioritiz ed list of
drivers in the system and calls the Supported() service for each one, passing in the device handle 1C. The
only driver that returns EFI

3.15.9 Boot Manager Connect All Processing
On some platforms, the boot manager may connect all drivers to all devices at this point in the platform
initializ ation sequence. However, platform firmware can choose to connect the minimum number of
drivers and devices that is required to establish consoles and gain access to the boot device.
Performing the minimum amount of work is recommended to enable shorter boot times.
If the platform firmware chooses to go into a "platform configuration" mode, then all the drivers should
be connected to all devices. The platform follows the following sequence:
1. A search is made of the handle database for all root controller handles. These handles do not have
a Driver Binding Protocol or the Loaded Image Protocol. They have a Device Path Protocol, and no
parent controllers.
2. ConnectController() is called with the R ecursive flag set to TRUE and a R emainingDevicePath of NULL for
each of the root controllers. These settings cause all children to be produced by all bus drivers.
3. As each bus is expanded, and if the bus supports storage devices for UEFI drivers, additional UEFI
drivers are then loaded from those storage devices (for example, option ROMs on PCI adapters).
4. This process is recursive. Each time a child handle is created, ConnectController() is called again on
that child handle, so all of those handle's children are produced.
5. When the process is complete, the entire tree of boot devices in the system hierarchy is present in
the handle database.

3.15.10 Boot Manager Driver List Processing
3.15.10 Boot Manager Driver List Processing
The platform boot manager loads the drivers that are specified by the DriverOrder and Driver####
environment variables. These environment variables are discussed in more detail in the Boot Manager
chapter of the UEFI Specification.
Before the platform boot manager loads each driver, it uses the device path stored in the Driver####
variable to connect the controllers and drivers that are required to access the driver option. This
process is exactly the same as the process used for the console variables ErrOut, ConOut, and ConIn.
If any driver in the DriverOrder list has a load attribute of LOAD
OPTION
FORCE
_
_
_
RECONNECT , then the platform boot
manager uses the DisconnectController() and
ConnectController() boot services to disconnect and reconnect all the drivers in the platform. This load
attribute allows the newly loaded drivers to be considered in the driver connection process.
For example, if no driver in the DriverOrder list has the LOAD
OPTION
FORCE
_
_
_
RECONNECT load attribute, then it
would be possible for a built-in system driver with a lower version number to manage a device. Then,
after loading a newer driver with a higher version number from the DriverOrder list, the driver with the
lower version number is still managing the same device.
However, if the newer driver in the DriverOrder list has a load attribute of LOAD
OPTION
FORCE
_
_
_
RECONNECT , then
the platform boot manager disconnects and reconnects all the controllers, so the driver with the
highest version number manages the same device that the lower versioned driver used to manage.
Drivers that are added to the DriverOrder list should not set the LOAD
OPTION
FORCE
RECONNECT attribute unless
_
_
_
they have to because the disconnect and reconnect process increases the boot time.

variables. These environment variables are more thoroughly discussed in the Boot Manager chapter of
the UEFI Specification. A boot option is typically an OS loader that never returns to UEFI, but boot
options can also be UEFI applications like diagnostic utilities or the UEFI Shell.
If a boot option does return to the platform boot manager, and the return status is not EFI
_
SUCCESS , then
the platform boot manager processes the next boot option. This process is repeated until an OS is
booted, EFI
_
SUCESS is returned by a boot option or the list of boot options is exhausted. Once the boot
process has halted, the platform boot manager may provide a user interface that allows the user to
manually boot an OS or manage the platform.
The platform boot manager uses the device path in each boot option to ensure that the device
required to access the boot option has been added to the UEFI handle database. This process is
exactly the same as the process used for the console variables ErrOut, ConOut, and ConIn.

4.1 Common Coding Practices
This section covers common coding practices for implementing UEFI Drivers. Following these practices
may improve a UEFI Driver's compatibility with different C compilers. The most important rule to follow is
to use ANSI C and to avoid the use of compiler specific language extensions. A voiding the use of
assembly language is also recommended.
A common approach when implementing a new UEFI Driver is to find an existing UEFI Driver with similar
features and functionality and use that existing UEFI Driver as a starting point for the new UEFI Driver.
Appendix B contains a table that lists some example UEFI Drivers provided in the EDK II and the features
implemented by those UEFI Drivers. The EDK II contains many more UEFI drivers than those listed in

4.1.3 Maximiz e W arning Levels
4.1.3 Maximize W arning Levels
T o catch possible issues with assigning or comparing values of different siz es, UEFI drivers should always
be compiled with the highest warning level possible. For example, the Microsoft* compilers support the
/WX and /W3 or /W4 compiler flags. The /WX flag causes any compile time warnings to generate an error,
so the build stops when a warning is generated. The /W3 and /W4 flags set the warning level to 3 and 4
respectively . At these warning levels, any siz e mismatches in assignments and comparisons generate a
warning. With the /WX flag, the compile stops when such siz e mismatches are detected.
If a UEFI Driver is being developed for a 32-bit architecture and is expected to be ported to a 64-bit
architecture, it is a good idea to compile the UEFI driver with a 64bit compiler during the development
process. This helps ensure the code is clean when validation on the 64-bit processor is begun. By using
the /WX and /W3 or /W4 compiler flags, any siz e mismatches that are generated by only 64-bit code are
detected.
TIP: As the warning levels are increased, a compiler may produce more error messages. This helps
develop more robust, portable code.

4.2.1 Never Assume all UEFI Drivers are Executed
T ypically, the same vendor that produces a UEFI driver also produces an OS-present driver for all the
operating systems that the vendor chooses to support. Because UEFI provides a mechanism to reduce
the boot time by running the minimum set of drivers that are required to connect the console and boot
devices, not all UEFI drivers may be executed on every boot. For example, the system may have three
SCSI cards but it only needs to install the driver on one SCSI bus in order to boot the OS.
This minimum set of drivers means that the OS-present driver may be handed a controller that may be in
several different states. It may still be in the power-on reset state, it may have been managed by a UEFI
driver for a short period of time and released, or it may have been managed by a UEFI driver right up to
the point in time where firmware hands control of the platform to the operating system.
The OS-present driver must accept controllers in all of these states. This acceptance requires the OS-
present driver to make very few assumptions about the state of the controller it manages.
Note: OS drivers shall not make assumptions that the UEFI driver has initializ ed or configured the
device in any way .
Note: I/O hot-plug does not involve UEFI driver execution, so the OS driver must be able to initializ e and
operate the driver without UEFI support.

4.2.2 Eliminate System Memory Assumptions
Do not make assumptions about the system memory configuration, including memory allocations and
memory that is used for DMA buffers. There may be unexpected gaps in the memory map in any system
and entire memory regions may be missing. For example, some memory regions could already be
allocated (such as for an I/O device), some memory may be non-addressable, and/or physical memory
could actually be missing. UEFI is designed for a wide variety of platforms. As such, portable drivers
should not have hard-coded limits. Instead, they should rely on published specifications, UEFI, and the
system firmware to provide them with the platform limitations and platform resources, including the
following:
The number of adapters that can be supported in a system
The type of adapter that can be supported on each bus
The available memory resources
In addition, drivers should not make assumptions on a platform. Instead, they should make sure they
support all the cases that are allowed by the UEFI Specification. For example, memory is not always
available beneath the 4 GB boundary (some systems may not have any memory under 4 GB at all) and
drivers have to be designed to be compatible with these types of system configurations. As another
example, some systems do not support PC-A T(R) legacy hardware and your drivers should not expect
them to be present.

4.2.3 Use UEFI Memory Allocation Services
4.2.3 Use UEFI Memory Allocation Services
The AllocatePool() service does not allow the caller to specify a preferred address so this service is
always safe to use and has no impact on platform compatibility . The AllocatePages() service does have a
mode that allows a specific address to be specified or a range of addresses to be specified. The
allocation type of AllocateAnyPages is safe to use and increases platform compatibility . The allocation types
of AllocateMaxAddress and AllocateAddress may reduce platform compatibility . R efer to Chapter 5 in this guide
for information about using the AllocatePages service.
The general guideline for UEFI drivers is to make as few assumptions about the memory configuration of
the platform as possible. This guideline applies to the memory that a UEFI driver allocates and the DMA
buffer addresses that DMA bus master's use. A UEFI driver should not allocate buffers from specific
addresses or below specific addresses. These types of allocations may fail on different system
configurations. The following rules help ensure a UEFI Driver makes appropriate memory allocations.
Use natural alignment (byte values on byte boundaries) when allocating buffers. This maximiz es
portability and helps avoid alignment faults on IPF platforms.
Buffers allocated on a 32-bit CPU architecture using the UEFI Boot Service AllocatePool()are
guaranteed to be below 4GB.
Buffers allocated on a 64-bit CPU architecture using the UEFI Boot Service AllocatePool() may be
above 4GB if memory is present above 4 GB.
The UEFI Boot Service AllocatePages() may be used to allocate a buffer anywhere system memory is
present. This means AllocatePages() may return a buffer on a 32-bit CPU architecture that is above
4 GB if memory is present above 4GB and that buffer can never be accessed.
All UEFI drivers must be aware that pointers may contain values above 4 GB, and care must be
taken never to strip the upper address bits.
T o prevent memory leaks, every allocation operation must have a corresponding free operation.
T est UEFI drivers on 64-bit architectures with memory configurations where system memory is
present above 4GB.

4.2.5 Never Directly Access Hardware R esources
4.2.5 Never Directly Access Hardware Resources
A UEFI driver should also never directly access any system chipset resources. Directly accessing these
resources limits the compatibility of the UEFI driver to systems only with that specific chipset.
Instead, the UEFI boot services, UEFI runtime services, and various protocol services should be used to
access the system resources that are required by a UEFI driver. The driver should look only for services
to hook into-a capability, such as a PCI bus. The driver then consumes the protocols necessary for
accessing that capability . It is the chipset's responsibility to get that capability ready for use.
TIP: The general rule is to only access the hardware that the UEFI Driver supports and use abstractions
for other hardware. If there is not an abstraction for a system device, do not use the device. That
device may change interface and functionality in the future.
This recommendation serves several purposes. By using the software abstractions provided by the
platform vendor, the UEFI driver maximiz es its platform compatibility . The platform vendor can also
optimiz e the services that are provided by the platform, so the performance of the UEFI driver improves
by using these services. Chapter 29 in this guide discusses the EBC porting considerations, and one of
the most important considerations is the performance of an EBC driver because EBC code is
interpreted. The performance of an EBC driver can be greatly improved by calling system services
instead of using internal functions.

4.2.6 Memory ordering
4.2.6 Memory ordering
Not all processors have strongly ordered memory models and some compilers, when high levels of
optimiz ation are enabled, may induce memory ordering issues. W eak ordering means that the order in
which memory transactions are presented in the C source code may not be the same order of
operations when the code is executed. IPF platforms are weakly ordered, so UEFI Drivers that are
compiled for IPF have to be aware of this issue. See A Formal Specification of Intel Itanium Processor
Family Memory Ordering for a detailed discussion of this topic. It is also discussed in the Intel Itanium
Architecture Software Developer Manuals.
TIP: Most of the details of memory ordering are taken care of by protocols and libraries. If protocols and
libraries are used to access hardware, then memory ordering issues should be hidden from a UEFI
Driver implementation. A direct access to hardware is not recommended
Normally, memory ordering is not an issue, because the processor and the compiler guarantee that the
code executes as the developer expects. However, UEFI drivers that access DMA buffers that are
simultaneously accessed by both the processor and the DMA bus master may run into issues if either
the processor or the DMA bus master, or both, are weakly ordered. The DMA bus master must resolve
its own memory ordering issues, but a UEFI Driver is responsible for managing the processor's ordering
issues.
The classic case where strong ordering versus weak ordering produces different results is when there is
a memory-based FIFO and a shared bus master "doorbell" register that is shared by all additions to the
FIFO. In this common implementation, the driver (producer) formats a new request descriptor and, as its
last logical operation, writes the value indicating the entry is valid.
This mechanism becomes a problem if a new request is being added to the FIFO while the bus master is
checking the next FIFO entry's valid flag. It is possible for the "last write" issued by the processor (that
turns on the valid flag) to be posted to memory before the logically earlier writes that finish initializ ing
the FIFO/request descriptor. The solution in this case is to ensure that all pending memory writes have
been completed before the "valid flag" is enabled. There are two techniques to avoid this problem:
Technique 1: Declare C data structures or portions of C data structures with the volatile attribute.
The compiler ensures that strong ordering is used for all operations to with that declaration.
Technique 2: Use the EDK II library BaseLib function called MemoryFence() . This function guarantees that
all the transactions in the source code prior to the MemoryFence() function are completed before the
code after the
MemoryFence() function is executed. On IPF platforms, this function executes a memory fence instruction.
Some compilers provide an intrinsic function that declares a barrier and, if this intrinsic is provided, the
EDK II implementation of MemoryFence() includes that barrier intrinsic. The barrier intrinsic is not really a
call. Instead, it prevents memory read/write transactions from being moved across the barrier as part of
the compiler code generation. This may be very important when high levels of compiler optimiz ation are
enabled.
The second technique is preferred for readability because the intent is clearer. A volatile declaration
tends to hide what was needed, because it is not part of the affected code (it is off in a structure
definition). In addition, the volatile declaration may impact the performance of the UEFI Driver's
because all memory transactions to the structure are strongly ordered.
It is recommended that these techniques be used appropriately in all driver types to maximiz e the UEFI
driver's platform compatibility .

4.2.9 R educe Poll Frequency
4.2.9 Reduce Poll Frequency
UEFI drivers operate in a polled mode and do not use interrupts. For example, UEFI drivers that
implement blocking I/O services can simply poll the device until the request is complete. UEFI drivers
that implement non-blocking I/O can create a periodic timer event to poll a device at periodic intervals.
A common mistake in UEFI drivers is polling too often.
R emember that polling, versus interrupts, is a pull model, not a push model. The tradeoff in a polling
system is how fast the device is polled (which can degrade system performance) versus how responsive
the driver is to that request. For example, in a polling system, the driver should not send a request to a
device and wait until that device responds before moving on to another task. In general, the polling
interval should be set to the largest possible period for the UEFI driver to complete its I/O services in a
reasonable period of time. The overall performance of a UEFI-enabled platform degrades if too many
UEFI drivers create high-frequency periodic timer events.
Note: It is recommended that the period of a periodic timer event be at least 10 ms. In general, the
period should be as large as possible based upon a specific device's timing requirements. Most drivers
can use events with timer periods in the range of 100 ms to several seconds.
When initially writing the driver, an estimate can be made for the initial polling frequency . However, the
polling frequency may have to be adjusted based on an analysis of the driver's performance on an
actual machine.
TIP: As part of the development process, make sure time is reserved for performance analysis to find
out how much time is taken up polling each device.
4.2.9.1 Distinguishing a polling issue versus another type of bug
The symptoms of a polling issue versus some other type of bug can look nearly identical. The key to
identifying a polling issue is: Don't assume anything. Begin simply by performing an analysis to get data-
the time taken by each task can be measured. If a task is taking longer than expected, the code
associated with that task can then be examined more closely .

Drivers may use events and TPLs if they perform non-blocking I/O. If they perform blocking I/O, then
events are not used. They may still use the RaiseTPL() and RestoreTPL() for critical sections.
Driver diagnostics are typically just applications. They do not normally need to use TPLs or events unless
the diagnostics is testing the TPL or event mechanisms in EFI. However, there is one exception. If a
diagnostic needs to guarantee that EFI's timer interrupt is disabled, then the diagnostic can raise the
TPL to TPL
HIGH
_
_
LEVEL . If this level is required, it should be done for the shortest possible time interval.
Caution: There are ways in which the platform firmware can be put into an undefined state by misuse
of the RaiseTPL() and RestoreTPL() functions.
Caution: Do not misuse the RaiseTPL() service by raising the task priority level too high for an extended
period of time. Raising the TPL level above TPLAPPLICA TION circumvents the timer tick. This can interfere
with other drivers, applications, and other elements that rely on the timer tick. It can cause extreme,
and sometimes catastrophic slowing of the system. It can cause other drivers, applications, and other
things that rely on the timer tick to fail. Always mirror the raise TPL service with the restore TPL service.

4.2.13 Do not use hidden PCI Option ROM Regions
Some option ROMs may use paging or other techniques to load and execute code that was not visible
to the system firmware when measuring the visible portion of the option ROM. This technique is
discouraged because it is the PCI bus driver's responsibility to extract the option ROM contents when a
PCI bus enumerates. If code were required to access hidden portions of an option ROM, then the PCI
bus driver would not have the ability to extract the additional PCI Option ROM contents.
This inability means that the UEFI drivers in a PCI Option ROM must be visible without accessing a hidden
portion of a PCI Option ROM. However, if there is a safe mechanism to access the hidden portions of the
PCI option ROM after the UEFI drivers have been loaded and executed, then the UEFI driver may choose
to access those contents. For example, non-volatile configuration information, utilities, or diagnostics
can be stored in the hidden PCI Option ROM regions.
Caution: The hidden option ROM regions are also not measurable via UEFI 2.3 and beyond signing and
verification interfaces. This makes them, and the system, less secure.

4.2.14 Store Configuration Data with Device
The configuration for a UEFI driver should be stored on the same field replaceable unit (FRU) as the
managed device. If a UEFI driver is stored on the motherboard, then the driver's configuration
information can be stored in UEFI variables. If a UEFI driver is stored in an add-in card, then the driver's
configuration information should be stored in the NVRAM provided on the add-in card.
4.2.14.1 Benefits
This method ensures that it is possible to statically determine the maximum configuration storage that
is required for the FRU during FRU design. In particular, if option cards stored their configuration in UEFI
variables, the amount of variable storage could not be statically calculated because it generally is not
possible to know the particular set of option cards installed in a system ahead of time. The result would
be that add-in cards could not be used in otherwise functional systems due to lack of UEFI variable
storage space.
Storing configuration data in the same FRU as the device reduces the amount of stale data left in UEFI
variables. If an option card stored its data in UEFI variables and was then removed, there would be no
automatic cleanup mechanism to purge the UEFI variables associated with that card.
Storing configuration data in the same FRU as the device also ensures that the configuration stays with
the FRU. It enables centraliz ed configuration of add-in cards. For example, if an IT department is
configuring 50 like systems, it can configure all 50 in the same system and then disburse them to the
systems, rather than configuring each system separately . It can also maintain preconfigured spares.

For example:
HID = "PNP0501"
ACPI = 0x0105D041
EFI = 0x050141D0
The significance is that operating systems that try to match the UEFI ACPI device path node to the ACPI

4.2.15.2 W orking with UEFI Device Path Nodes
UEFI Device Paths Nodes are not required to be aligned. If the proper coding style is used when working

Nodes are accessed with natural alignment. This improves platform compatibility, especially for IPF
platforms.
TIP: Do not assume that, when given a device path, that the path is aligned. Copy pieces of the device
path to a known-aligned device path before accessing it. The device path may then be accessed safely .
Alternatively, use EDK II BaseLib functions to perform unaligned reads and writes.

Caution: On a boot or reboot, there shall be no writes to shared storage without user

4.2.17 Limit use of Console Services
PC BIOS legacy option ROMs typically display banners and allow hotkey(s) to enter the configuration
area for a particular card. Current UEFI drivers use HII functionality to allow access to system
configuration areas.
Because UEFI drivers now have HII functionality, the UEFI Driver Model requires that no console I/O
operations take place in the UEFI Driver Binding Protocol functions. A reasonable exception to this rule
is to use the DEBUG() macro to display progress information during driver development and debug. Using
the DEBUG() macro allows the code for displaying the data to be easily removed for a production build of
the driver.
Use of the DEBUG() macro should be limited to "debug releases" of a driver. This strategy typically works
if the driver is loaded after the UEFI console is connected. However, because console drivers may live in
option ROMs, some firmware implementations may load the option ROM drivers before the UEFI console
is connected. In such cases, the ConOut and StdErr fields of the UEFI system table may be NULL , and
printing can crash the system. The DEBUG() macro should check to see if the field is NULL before using
those services.

4.2.18 Offer alternatives to function keys
Configuration of drivers should be accomplished via HII and via OS-present interfaces.
There are design considerations when interacting outside of configuration. First, consider using the
setup interface as the user interface for a UEFI driver. The user already understands the interface and
remote use is already enabled. If the existing high level interfaces cannot be used, then follow the
design considerations for using console based services.
UEFI drivers should use the console input services (see Section 22.2 of this guide), and then be aware
of alternatives to function keys. This is because the UEFI console may be connected through a serial
port. In such cases, it is sensitive to the correct terminal emulator configuration. If the terminal
emulator is not correctly configured to match the terminal settings in UEFI (PC ANSI, VT100, VT100+, or
VT -UTF8), some of the keys (function keys, arrow keys (page up/down, insert/delete, and backspace),
may not work correctly, display colors properly nor render the correct cursor positioning.
Note: T o better support users, it is recommended that UEFI configuration protocols and UEFI
applications create user interfaces that are not solely dependent on these keys but instead offer
alternatives for these keys.
Note: It is important to be aware that the Simple Input Protocol does not support the CTRL or AL T keys
because these keys are not available with remote terminals such as terminal emulators and telnet.
The following table shows one possible set of alternate key sequences for function keys, arrow keys,
page up/down keys, and the insert/delete keys. Each configuration protocol and application decides if
alternate key sequences are supported and which alternate mappings should be used. The table also

4.3 Maximiz e CPU Compatibility
4.3 Maximize CPU Compatibility
UEFI Drivers should be designed to maximiz e source code portability since it is possible to write a single
UEFI Driver that compiles on all CPU architectures supported by the UEFI Specification. The list of
supported CPU architectures may grow over time, so it is important to follow these portability guidelines.
The guidelines presented here apply to all CPU architectures. Chapter 28 covers portability issues
specific to IPF platforms, and Chapter 29 covers portability issues that are specific to EBC.
When porting between CPU architectures, most developers take as much existing code as possible and
reuse it. Unfortunately, some developers porting code do not rigorously follow the UEFI conventions,
such as using only the data types defined in the Calling Conventions section of the UEFI Specification.
Others may not follow best coding practices.
Use data types defined by the Calling Conventions section of the UEFI Specification.
Use compiler flag settings to guarantee that the UEFI calling conventions for the CPU architecture
are followed. See the Calling Conventions section of the UEFI Specification for details.
If a UEFI driver contains assembly language sources, then either the source needs to be ported or it
needs to be converted to C language source. Conversion to C language source is recommended. The
EDK II library BaseLib, and other EDK II libraries, provide functions that may reduce, or even eliminate,
the need to assembly code in UEFI Drivers.
TIP: Implement UEFI Drivers in C to maximiz e portability,
A void use of C++. It is not supported by EBC.
A void unaligned data accesses. Compilers, by default, generate code and data that perform aligned
accesses. Unaligned data accessed are generated when features such as byte-packed structures,
type casting pointers, or assembly language are used. Aligned data accesses typically execute
faster than unaligned data accesses. Parsing UEFI Device Paths is a common generator of
unaligned data accesses. These generate alignment faults on IPF platforms.
The best approach to debugging a UEFI Driver ported to a differing CPU architecture is to keep a
good code base with every revision. This allows comparison with earlier revisions to see the source
code before and after the problem became visible.
If source code is not available, the CPU register state may not be sufficient to debug a specific
issue. K eep in mind that a "new" problem might have nothing to do with a recent change to the
code. A pre-existing problem might not have shown up before for a variety of reasons. For example,
the current developer might have included error checking or exercised the error handling registers
after making an addition to the code-error checking that might not have been done before. Or a
new addition might make the pre-existing problem worse, so the problem finally becomes visible in
the new revision.
Perform a minimal port first to test simple parts of the UEFI driver. This is simply good porting
practices, but even experienced developers can forget to port and test the simple things first. Start
with a known-good sample driver that is extremely simple. For example, a driver that prints "Hello
W orld"
. Then divide the code into sections. Begin inserting and testing the less complicated
sections into the known-good driver, one section at a time. Another technique is to replace more
complex code with "neutered" code that returns but doesn't actually do anything. Make sure the

simple sections work and do not cause alignment faults or other errors. Only then should the more

4.3.1 Assignment and comparison operators
4.3.1 Assignment and comparison operators
There are issues that, if a data value is cast from a larger siz e to a smaller siz e, the upper bits of the
larger values are stripped. In general, this stripping causes a compiler warning, so these are easy
issues to catch. However, there are a few cases where compilation is free of errors and warnings on 32-
bit platforms but generates errors or warnings on 64-bit platforms. The only way to guarantee catching
these errors early on is to compile for both 32-bit and 64-bit processors during the entire development
process.
When a warning is generated by a 64-bit processor, it can be eliminated by explicitly casting the larger
data type to the smaller data type. However, the developer needs to make sure that this casting is the
right solution because the upper bits of the larger data value are stripped.
The example below shows several examples that generate a warning and how to eliminate it with an
explicit cast. The last example is the most interesting because it does not generate any warnings on a
32-bit architecture, but does on 64-bit. This difference is because a UINTN on 32-bit CPUs is identical to
UINT32 , but UINTN on 64-bit CPUs is identical to a UINT64 .
Example 8-Assignment operation warnings
# include <Uefi.h>
UINT8 Value8;
UINT16 Value16;
UINT32 Value32;
UINT64 Value64;
UINTN ValueN;
//
// Warning generated on 32-bit CPU
// Warning generated on 64-bit CPU
//
Value8 = Value16;

Example 9, below, is very similar to Example 8 except the assignments have been replaced with
comparison operations. The same issues shown are generated by all the comparison operators,
including > , < , >=
, <=
, !=
, and ==
. The solution is to cast one of the two operands to be the same
as the other operand. The first four cases are the ones that work on 32-bit platforms with no errors or
warnings but generate warnings on 64-bit architectures. The next four cases resolve the issue by
casting the first operand, and the last four cases resolve the issue by casting the second operand.
Care must be taken when casting the correct operand because a cast from a larger data type to a
smaller data type strips the upper bits of the operand. When a cast is performed to INTN or UINTN , a
different number of bits are stripped for 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.

4.3.2 Casting pointers
4.3.2 Casting pointers
Pointers can be cast from one pointer type to another pointer type. However, pointers should never be
cast to a fixed-siz e data type, and fixed-siz e data types should never be cast to pointers.
The siz e of a pointer varies depending on the platform architecture, such as 32-bit versus 64-bit
platforms. If any assumptions are made that a pointer to a function or a pointer to a data structure is a
32-bit value, then that code may not run on 64-bit platforms with physical memory above 4 GB.

4.3.3 Converting pointers
4.3.3 Converting pointers
Be mindful when converting physical addresses to pointers on 64-bit architectures. All UEFI driver writers
must be aware that pointers may contain values above 4 GB, and that care must be taken never to strip
the upper address bits. If the upper address bits are stripped, the driver may work on 32-bit
architectures, and on 64-bit architectures with small memory configurations, but may not work on 64-bit
platforms with larger memory configurations.
Note: Make sure the driver does not strip the upper address bits when converting pointers.
4.3.3.1 The Exception to the Rule
There is one exception to this rule of casting pointers and it applies to both32-bit and 64-bit
processors. The data types INTN and UINTN are the exact same siz e of pointers on both 32-bit and 64-
bit platforms, which means that a pointer can be cast to or from INTN or UINTN without any adverse side
effects. However, ANSI C does not require function pointers to be the same siz e as data pointers. Also,
function pointers and data pointers are not required to be the same siz e as INTN or UINTN . As a result,
this exception does not apply to all processors.
4.3.3.2 Identifying a Pointer Problem
Problems caused by mistakes in pointer casting are difficult to catch. This is so because explicit casts
are required to cast a fixed-width type to a pointer or vice versa. Once these explicit type casts are
introduced, no compiler warnings or errors are generated. In fact, the code may execute fine on, for
example, 32-bit platforms and on 64-bit platforms with physical memory below 4 GB. The only failing case
is when the code is tested on a 64-bit system with physical memory above 4 GB. The symptom is typically
a processor exception that results in a system hang or reset.
The example below shows some good and bad examples of casting pointers. The first group is casting
pointers to pointers. The second group is casting pointers to fixed width types, and the last group is
casting fixed width types to pointers.

4.3.4 UEFI Data T ype Siz es
4.3.4 UEFI Data T ype Sizes
Note that a few UEFI data types are different siz es on 32-bit architectures versus 64bit architectures as
follow :
Pointers
Enumerations
INTN
UINTN
The result of these differing types is that that any complex types, such as unions and data structures,
that are composed of these base types also have different siz es on 32bit architectures versus 64-bit
architectures. These differences must be kept in mind whenever the sizeof() operator is used.
If a union or data structure is required that does not change siz e between 32-bit and 64-bit
architectures, then no changes are required.
For interoperability, only the data types defined in the Calling Conventions section of the UEFI
Specification should be used. Some of these data types change based on the selected compiler, and
should not cause a fault in the code. If a new data type is defined, then an alignment fault or other
error could be generated.

4.3.5 Negative Numbers
4.3.5 Negative Numbers
Negative numbers are not the same on 32-bit versus 64-bit processors. Negative numbers are type
INTN . T ype INTN is a 4-byte container on a 32-bit processor and an 8byte container on a 64-bit
processor. For example, -1 on a 32-bit CPU is 0xFFFFFFFF , and -1 on the 64-bit CPU is 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF .
Caution: Be careful when assigning or comparing negative numbers. Negative numbers have different
values on different architectures. For example, do not compare -1 to 0xFFFFFFFF, compare -1 to -1 and
compare 0xFFFFFFFF to 0xFFFFFFFF . If the siz e of the values change, then the same compares may
return different results.
The following example shows sample code that compiles without errors or warnings on both 32-bit and
64-bit architectures. However, the sample behaves very differently on 32-bit architectures versus 64-bit
architectures.

4.3.6 R eturning Pointers in a Function Parameter
4.3.6 Returning Pointers in a Function Parameter
The following example shows a bad example for casting pointers. The function MyFunction() returns a 64-
bit value in an OUT parameter that is assigned from a 32-bit input parameter. There is nothing wrong
with MyFunction() . The problem is when MyFunction() is called. Here, the address of B , a 32-bit container,
is cast to a pointer to a 64-bit container and passed to MyFunction() . MyFunction() writes to 64 bits
starting at B . This location happens to overwrite the value of B and the value of A in the calling
function.
The first Print() correctly shows the values of A and B . The second Print() shows that B was given
A 's original value, but the contents of A were destroyed and overwritten with a 0.
The cast from &B to a (UINT64*) is the problem here. This code compiles without errors or warnings on
both 32-bit and 64-bit processors. It executes on 32-bit and 64-bit processors with these unexpected
side effects. It might also generate an alignment fault on IPF if &B is not 64-bit aligned. One possible fix
for this issue is to change B from a UINT32 to a UINT64 .

4.3.7 Array Subscripts
4.3.7 Array Subscripts
In general, array subscripts should be of type INTN or UINTN . Using these types avoids problems if an
array subscript is decremented below 0 . If a UINT32 is used as an array subscript and is decremented
below 0, it is decremented to 0xFFFFFFFF on a 32-bit processor and 0x00000000FFFFFFFF on a 64-bit
processor. These subscript values are very different. On 32-bit architectures, this value is the same
indexing element as -1 of the array . However, on a 64-bit processor, this value is the same indexing
element as 0xFFFFFFFF of the array .
If an INTN or UINTN is used instead of a UINT32 for the array subscript, then this problem goes away .
When a UINTN is decremented below 0 , it is decremented to 0xFFFFFFFF on a 32-bit processor and
0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF on a 64-bit processor. These values are both the same indexing element as -1 of the
array .
The following example shows two array subscripts. The first one works on 32-bit architectures but
accesses a very high address on 64-bit architectures that may generate a fault or hang condition. The
second array subscript is rewritten to work properly on both 32-bit architectures and 64-bit
architectures.

T echniques to improve the performance of UEFI drivers
Sometimes these techniques complement each other―sometimes they are at odds with each other. For

Maximiz es the use of library classes defined in the MdePkg and MdeModulePkg.
In some cases, multiple implementations of the same library class may be
provided. Some implementations may be smaller and others may be faster. If a
UEFI Driver implementation maximiz es its use of library functions from EDK II
packages, then the UEFI Driver can be built with library instance mappings
defined in the DSC file that minimiz e the siz e of a UEFI Driver.
Some compiler provide flags (such as /Os and /O1) optimiz e code for space. This
is an easy way to reduce the siz e of a UEFI driver.
Note: When optimiz ation is turned on, each line of source code may not map to
the same line when a debugger is active. This can make it more difficult to
debug.
TIP: Be careful when turning on compiler optimiz ations because C source that
works fine with optimiz ations disabled may stop working with optimiz ations
enabled. They usually stop working because of missing volatile declarations on
variables and data structures that are shared between normal contexts and
raised TPL contexts or DMA bus masters.
TIP: When optimiz ed for speed, the UEFI driver is small, and may execute faster.
If there are any speed paths in a UEFI driver that cause problems if the UEFI
driver executes faster, then these switches may expose those speed paths.
These same speed paths also show up as faster processors are used, so it is
good to find these speed paths early .
Some linkers provide flags (such as /OPT :REF) that remove unused functions and
variables from the executable image, including functions and variables in the
UEFI driver and the libraries against which the UEFI driver is being linked. The
combination of using the UEFI driver library with this linker switch can
significantly reduce the siz e of a UEFI driver executable. The EDK II enabled
these types of flags by default.
If a UEFI Driver is stored in a PCI option ROM, the UEFI compression algorithm
can be used to further reduce the siz e of a UEFI driver. The build utility EfiRom
has built-in support for compressing UEFI images. The PCI bus driver has built-in
support for decompressing UEFI drivers stored in PCI option ROMs. The average
compression ratio on IA32 is 2.3, and the average compression ratio on the IPF
platform is 2.8 The EfiR om utility is described in Chapter 18 of this guide.
If a UEFI driver is going to be stored in a PCI option ROM, and the PCI option ROM
must support both IA32 and IPF platforms, or just IPF platforms, EFI Byte Code
(EBC) executables should be considered. EBC executables are portable between
IA32 and IPF platforms. This portability means that only a single UEFI driver
image is required to support both IA32 and IPF platforms. Also, the EBC
executables are significantly smaller than images for the IPF platform, so there
are advantages to using this format for UEFI drivers that are targeted only at IPF
platforms. In addition, using EFI Compression (see above) can reduce the EBC
executables even further.

Protocol
Some compiler provide flags (such as /Ot, /O2, and /Ox) optimiz e code for
performance. This technique is an easy way to reduce the execution time of a
UEFI driver. For the most part, the EDK II balances siz e and speed optimiz ations.
The flags can be customiz ed to specify a preference for speed or siz e.
Note: When optimiz ation is turned on, each line of source code may not map to
the same line when a debugger is active. This can make it more difficult to debug.
TIP: Be careful when turning on compiler optimiz ations because C source that
works fine with optimiz ations disabled may stop working with optimiz ations
enabled. They usually stop working because of missing volatile declarations on
variables and data structures that are shared between normal contexts and
raised TPL contexts.
TIP: Because the UEFI driver is small, it may execute faster. If there are any
speed paths in a UEFI driver that cause problems if the UEFI driver executes
faster, then these switches may expose those speed paths. These same speed
paths also show up as faster processors are used, so it is good to find these
speed paths early .
Whenever possible, use UEFI boot services, UEFI runtime services, and the
protocol services provided by other UEFI drivers. The UEFI boot services and UEFI
runtime services are likely implemented as native calls that have been optimiz ed
for the platform, so there is a performance advantage for using these services.
Some protocol services might be native, and other protocol services might be EBC
images. Either way, if all UEFI drivers assume that external protocol services are
native, then the combination of UEFI drivers and EFI services result in more
efficient execution.
If a UEFI driver is a PCI driver, then it should take advantage of all the PCI I/O
Protocol services to improve the UEFI driver's performance. This approach means
that all register accesses should be performed at the largest possible siz e. For
example, perform a single 32-bit read instead of multiple 8-bit reads. Also, take
advantage of the read/write multiple, FIFO, and fill modes of the Io() , Mem() , and
Pci() services. See Chapter 18 for details on optimiz ation techniques that are
specific to PCI.

4.4.3 CopyMem() and SetMem() Operations
The following example shows how to use the EDK II library BaseMemoryLib functions CopyMem() and SetMem() to
improve the performance of a UEFI driver. These techniques apply to arrays, structures, or allocated
buffers.
Note: By default, the EDK II enables high levels of optimiz ation, so this example may not build for all
compilers because the loops are optimiz ed into intrinsics that can cause the link to fail. So not only
does use of 'CopyMem()' and 'SetMem()' improve performance, it also improves UEFI Driver portability .

5.1.1 Memory Allocation Services
5.1.1 Memory Allocation Services
The AllocatePool() and FreePool() boot services are used by UEFI drivers to allocate and free small buffers
that are guaranteed to be aligned on an 8-byte boundary . These services are ideal for allocating and
freeing data structures.
The AllocatePages() and FreePages() boot services are used by UEFI drivers to allocate and free larger
buffers that are guaranteed to be aligned on a 4 KB boundary . These services allow buffers to be
allocated at any available address, at specific addresses, or below a specific address.
5.1.1.1 Critical considerations for allocating memory
UEFI drivers should not make assumptions about the organiz ation of system memory . Because of this,
allocating from specific addresses or below specific addresses is strongly discouraged. The
AllocatePool() service does not allow the caller to specify a preferred address, so this service is safe to
use and does not impact the compatibility of a UEFI Driver on different platforms.
The AllocatePages() service does have a mode that allows a specific address to be specified or a range of
addresses to be specified. The allocation type of
AllocateAnyPages is safe to use and increases the compatibility of UEFI Drivers on different platforms. The
allocation types of AllocateMaxAddress and AllocateAddress may reduce platform compatibility, so their use is
discouraged.
Caution: Although the Allocate services allow for specific memory allocation, do not allocate specific
addresses in a UEFI driver. Allocating buffers at a specific address could result in errors, including a
catastrophic failure on some platforms. Memory allocation in UEFI drivers should be done dynamically .
TIP: Always check function return codes to verify if a memory allocation request succeeded or not
before accessing the allocated buffer.
K ey points:
T o prevent memory leaks, every allocation operation must have a corresponding free operation. It is
important to note that some UEFI services allocate buffers for the caller and expect the caller to
free those buffers.
Buffers above 4 GB may be allocated if there is system memory is present above 4 GB. As a result,
all UEFI drivers must be aware that pointers may contain address values above 4 GB, and care must
be taken never to strip the upper address bits.
Structures and values placed in allocated buffers must be naturally aligned to maximiz e compatibility
with all CPU architectures.
Never use an allocated buffer for DMA without mapping it through an I/O Protocol. For example, the
Map() and UnMap() services in the PCI I/O Protocol.
R efer to Chapter 4 for general porting considerations covering more memory allocation details for 32-bit
and 64-bit architectures.

EDK II Driver W riter's Guide for UEFI 2.3.1[DRAFT]
5.1.1 Memory Allocation Services
A UEFI driver must never directly allocate a memory buffer for DMA access. The UEFI driver cannot know
enough about the system architecture to predict what system memory areas are available for DMA or if
CPU caches are coherent with DMA operations. Instead, a UEFI driver must use the services provided by
the I/O protocol for the bus to allocate and free buffers required for DMA operations. There should also
be services to initiate and complete DMA transactions. For example, the PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol and
PCI I/O Protocol both provide services for PCI DMA operations. As additional I/O bus types with DMA
capabilities are introduced, new protocols that abstract the DMA services must be provided.
5.1.1.3 Allocating and freeing buffers
UEFI boot service drivers typically allocate and free buffers of type EfiBootServicesData . UEFI runtime drivers
typically allocate and free buffers of type EfiRuntimeServicesData . OS Loaders typically allocate and free
buffers of type EfiLoaderData .
Most drivers that follow the UEFI driver model allocate private context structures in their Driver Binding
Protocol Start() function and free them in their Driver Binding Protocol Stop() function. UEFI drivers may
also dynamically allocate and free buffers as different I/O operations are performed.
5.1.1.4 Code examples for AllocatePool() and FreePool()
The following code fragment shows how the UEFI Boot Service AllocatePool() and FreePool() can be used
to allocate and free a buffer for a data structure from EfiBootServicesData memory . The EDK II library
UefiBootServicesTableLib provides global variables for the UEFI System T able, the UEFI Boot Services T able,
and the Image Handle for the currently executing driver. In this example, the global variable for the UEFI
Boot Services T able, called gBS, is used to call the UEFI Boot Services AllocatePool() and FreePool().
Example 16-Allocate and free pool using UEFI Boot S ervices Table
# include <Uefi.h>
# include <Library/UefiBootServicesTableLib.h>

return Status;
DEVICE),
}
//
// Free the allocated buffer
//
Status = gBS->FreePool (Device);
if (EFI
_
ERROR (Status)) {
return Status;
}
The code fragment below shows exactly the same functionality as Example 16, above, but uses EDK II
library MemoryAllocationLib to simplify the implementation. The MemoryAllocationLib function AllocatePool()
allocates memory of type EfiBootServicesData . If memory of type EfiRuntimeServicesData is required, then the
MemoryAllocationLib function AllocateRuntimePool() should be used.

In many cases, when a structure is allocated, it is useful to clear the buffer to a known state with z eros.
The following code fragment in Example 18 expands on Example 17, above, showing how the EDK II
library MemoryAllocationLib can be used to allocate and clear a buffer in a single call.
Example 18-Allocate and clear pool using MemoryAllocationLib
# include <Uefi.h>

//
// Free the allocated buffer

Complex structures that require many fields to be initializ ed after the structure is allocated may
increase the siz e of the UEFI driver if the fields are initializ ed one by one. The EDK II library
MemoryAllocationLib provides an additional allocation method that makes use of a template structure to
reduce code siz e.
The concept is that a template structure can be declared as a global variable with all the fields pre-
initializ ed to the required values. It takes less space to store just the data than it does to store the
instructions and data to initializ e all the fields one by one. This technique may be useful for UEFI Drivers
that produce new protocols for each device the UEFI Driver manages. Example 19, below, expands on
the above Example 18 showing how the EDK II library MemoryAllocationLib is used to allocate and initializ e a
buffer from a template structure in a single call.

In some rare circumstances, a UEFI Driver may be required to allocate a buffer with a specific alignment.
AllocatePool() provides 8-byte alignment. AllocatePages() provides 4KB alignment. If an alignment above
4KB is required, the preferred technique is to allocate a large buffer through AllocatePages() , find the
portion of the allocated buffer that meets the required alignment, and free the unused portions. EDK II
library MemoryAllocationLib provides the function called AllocateAlignedPages() that implements this technique.
The code fragment in the example below allocates a 16KB buffer aligned on a 64KB boundary .

5.1.2 Miscellaneous Services
5.1.2 Miscellaneous Services
The SetMem() and CopyMem() UEFI Boot Services are used by UEFI drivers to initializ e the contents of a
buffer or copy a buffer from one location to another. The SetMem() service is most commonly used to fill
the contents of a buffer with z eros after it is allocated. The CopyMem() service handles buffers of any
alignment and also handles the rare case when the source and destination buffer overlap. With
overlapping buffers, the requirement is that the destination buffer on exit from this service must match
the contents of the source buffer on entry to this service.
The code fragments in this section also show examples that use the EDK II library class BaseMemoryLib as
an alternative to using the UEFI Boot Services directly . The advantage of using this library class is that
the source code can be implemented just once. The EDK II DSC file used to build a UEFI Driver can
specify mappings to different implementations of the BaseMemoryLib library class that meet the
requirements of a specific target. For example, the MdePkg/Library/UefiMemoryLib library instance uses the
recommended UEFI Boot Services SetMem() and CopyMem() are for best performance when building a UEFI
Driver for EBC. For best performance on IA32 or X 64, use the SSE2 optimiz ed MdePkg/Library/BaseMemoryLibSse2
library instance.
5.1.2.1 Code examples for SetMem()
Use the SetMem() UEFI Boot Service to initializ e the contents of a buffer with a specified value. UEFI
drivers most commonly use this service to z ero an allocated buffer, but it can also be used to fill a buffer
with other values. The following code fragment in the example below shows the same example from
Example 16, but uses SetMem() UEFI Boot Service to z ero the contents of the allocated buffer. The EDK II
library
UefiBootServicesTableLib provides global variables for the UEFI System T able, the UEFI Boot Services T able,
and the Image Handle for the currently executing driver. Here, the global variable for the UEFI Boot
Services T able called gBS is used to call the UEFI Boot Services AllocatePool() and SetMem().

5.1.3 Handle Database and Protocol Services
5.1.3 Handle Database and Protocol Services
There are several UEFI Boot Services used to add, retrieve, and remove contents from the Handle
Database. Concepts of the Handle Database and Protocols are introduced in Section 3.4. This section
provides code examples for the UEFI Boot Services commonly used by UEFI Drivers to manage the
Handle Database and include the following:
InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces()
UninstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces()
LocateHandleBuffer()
LocateProtocol()
OpenProtocol()
OpenProtocolInformation()
CloseProtocol()
5.1.3.1 InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() and UninstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces()
These services are used to do the following:
Create new handles in the Handle Database.
R emove a handle from the Handle Database.
Add protocols to an existing handle in the Handle Database.
R emove protocols from an existing handle in the Handle Database.
Extra services to create a new handle in the Handle Database and remove an existing handle from the
Handle Database are not required. Instead, the first protocol installed onto a handle automatically
creates a new handle and adds that handle to the Handle Database. The last protocol removed from an
existing handle automatically removes the handle from the Handle Database and destroys the handle.
This means it is not possible for a handle to be present in the Handle Database with z ero protocols
installed.
Another important concept is that a single handle in the Handle Database is not allowed to have more
than one instance of the same Protocol installed onto that handle. If a UEFI Driver is required to
produce more than one instance of the same protocol, then the Protocol instances must be installed
on different handles in the Handle Database.
UEFI Drivers tend to manage more than one protocol at a time. Because of this, it is recommended that
InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() and UninstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() be used instead of the
InstallProtocolInterface() and UninstallProtocolInterface() . This results in source code that is easier to
maintain and also tends to produce smaller executables. In addition, InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces()
provides more extensive error checking than InstallProtocolInterface() , which allows developers to catch
coding errors sooner, and results in higher quality UEFI Driver implementations. The main difference is
that InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() guarantees that a duplicate Device Path
Protocol is never be added to the Handle Database. Section 3.9 introduces the concept of Device Paths
and the requirement for them to be unique.
The InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() and UninstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() services support adding and
removing more than one protocol at a time through the use of a variable argument list. Protocols are
represented by a pair of pointers to a protocol GUID and a protocol interface. These services parse
pairs of arguments until a NULL pointer for the protocol GUID parameter is encountered.

EDK II Driver W riter's Guide for UEFI 2.3.1[DRAFT]
5.1.3 Handle Database and Protocol Services
Note: If any errors are generated when the protocols are being added to a handle, any protocols
added before the error is returned, are automatically removed by InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces().
This means the state of the handle in the handle database is identical to the state prior to the call.
Note: If any errors are generated when the protocols are being removed from a handle, any protocols
removed before the error is returned, are automatically added back by
UninstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces(). This means the state of the handle in the handle database is
identical to the state prior to the call.
TIP: If unexpected errors are returned by these services, try converting a single call for multiple
protocols to a series of calls that process one protocol at a time. This allows the specific protocol
causing the error condition to be identified. It should be rare for these services to return an error
condition. If an error condition is present it is likely due to a duplicate GUID, a duplicate device path, or
an invalid handle.
Note: When an attempt is made to remove a protocol interface from a handle in the handle database,
the UEFI core firmware checks to see if any other UEFI drivers are currently using the services of the
protocol to be removed. If UEFI drivers are using that protocol interface, the UEFI core firmware
attempts to stop those UEFI drivers with a call to DisconnectController(). This is a quick, legal, and safe
way to shut down any protocols associated with this driver's stack.
Caution: A serious issue can occur when a user removes and then reattaches a device on a bus that
supports hot-plugging. Driver writers must consider this when writing drivers for hot-plug devices.
The issue occurs when other controllers are also using one, or more, of a driver's protocols. In these
cases, the UninstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces service fails.
If the call to DisconnectController() fails, the UEFI core firmware then calls ConnectController() to put the
handle database back into the same state that it was in prior to the original call to
UninstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() . This call to ConnectController() has the potential to cause issues upon re-
entry in UEFI drivers that must be handled in the UEFI driver. These issues could include lost or missed
connected pointer linkages resulting in lost data, confused operation, crashes and other errors. See
_
Chapter 31 in this guide for recommendations on how to test UEFI drivers.
_
5.1.3.1.1 Protocols that may be added at the driver entry point
The following protocols may also be added in the driver entry point with the
InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() service. Please see Chapter 7 for more details on how to install these
protocols in a driver entry point along with the recommendations on when each of these protocols
should be installed in a driver entry point. Later chapters of this guide cover the implementation of
these protocols in more detail.

5.1.3.1.2 Removing protocols when a driver is unloaded
If a UEFI driver is unloadable, then the protocols that were added in the driver entry point must be
removed in the driver's Unload() function using UninstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() .
TIP: Although the Unload() function is optional, uninstalling the protocols in the Unload() function of a
driver is not optional. The install and uninstall sections must mirror each other for the protocols used by
the driver.
TIP: The load and unload UEFI Shell commands may be used to test driver load and unload services for
handles and protocols.
5.1.3.1.3 Code example
The following code fragment shows how InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() can be used from the entry point
of a UEFI Driver to install driver related protocols. This example installs the Driver Binding Protocol,
required for UEFI Drivers that follow the UEFI Driver Model, along with the Component Name 2 Protocol
which is optional for UEFI Drivers that follow the UEFI Driver Model. Both protocols are installed onto the
image handle passed into the entry point of the UEFI Driver, and the call to
InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() uses GUID/Pointer pairs terminated by a NULL GUID value. Additional
optional protocols could be added to this one call to InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() depending on a
specific UEFI Driver requirements and capabilities.
Example 28-Install protocols in UEFI Driver entry point.

The code fragment in Example 29 performs the same work as the example above, but uses the EDK II
UefiLib to install the UEFI Driver Model related protocols. In this specific case, the Driver Binding
Protocol, Component Name Protocol, and Component Name 2 Protocols are all installed using the
UefiLib function EfiLibInstallDriverBindingComponentName2() . The Component Name Protocol and Component
Name 2 Protocol implementations use the same functions for their protocol implementations, thereby
reducing the siz e overhead for supporting both name protocols.
The EDK II UefiLib provides 4 functions that may be used to initializ e a UEFI Driver that follows the UEFI
Driver Model. The Component Name Protocols are declared with GLOBAL

guarantees the protocol structures are removed from the final binary UEFI Driver image if the EDK II
build is configured to not produce the Component Name Protocols. It does not make sense to use that
declaration style for the Driver Binding Protocol since that protocol must always be produced by a UEFI
Driver that follows the UEFI Driver Model.
The EDK II library UefiLib uses several Platform Configuration Database (PCD) feature flags to enable
and disable the Component Name Protocols at build time. Chapter 30 covers how to build UEFI Drivers in
the EDK II and also covers configuration of UEFI Drivers through PCD settings.

The code fragment below shows how the protocols installed in the previous example would be
uninstalled in a UEFI Driver's Unload() function. A UEFI Driver is not required to implement the Unload()
capability, but if the Unload() capability is implemented, it must undo the work performed in the entry
point of the UEFI Driver just like InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() . UninstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() allows
multiple protocols to be specified in a single call using a set of GUID/Pointer arguments terminated by a

UEFI device drivers add protocols for I/O services to existing handles in the handle database in their
Start() function and remove those same protocols from those same handles in their Stop() function.
UEFI bus drivers may add protocols to existing handles, but they are also responsible for creating
handles for the child device on that bus. This responsibility means that the UEFI bus driver typically adds

5.1.3.4 OpenProtocol() and CloseProtocol()
The OpenProtocol() and CloseProtocol() services are used by UEFI drivers to acquire and release the
protocol interfaces from the handle database that the UEFI drivers require to produce their services.
The OpenProtocol() service is one of the most complex UEFI Boot Services because it is required to
support all of the various UEFI Driver types. UEFI applications and UEFI OS loaders may also use these
services to lookup and use protocol interfaces in the handle database.
Caution: Proper use of 'OpenProtocol()' and 'CloseProtocol()' is required for interoperability with other
UEFI components. There are UEFI Shell commands that may be used to help verify the proper use of
these services including 'dh'
,
'connect'
,
'disconnect'
,
'reconnect'
,
'drivers'
,
'devices'
,
'devtree'
, and
'openinfo'
.
OpenProtocol() is typically used by the Supported() and Start() functions of a UEFI driver to retrieve
protocol interface(s) that are installed on handles in the handle database. The code, below, shows the
full function prototype for the UEFI Boot Service OpenProtocol()

The Handle and Protocol parameters specify what protocol interface is being opened. The AgentHandle
and ControllerHandle specifies who is opening the protocol interface.
The Attributes parameter specifies why a protocol interface is being opened. The Interface parameter is
used to return the protocol interface if it is successfully opened, and the EFI
STATUS return code tells if
_
the protocol interface was opened or not and if not, why it could not be opened. The UEFI core records
these input parameter values to track how each protocol interface is being used. This tracking
information can be retrieved through the OpenProtocolInformation() service. The EFI
_
STATUS code returned by
OpenProtocol() is very important and must be examined by UEFI drivers that use this service. In some
cases, error code such as EFI
ALREADY
_
_
STARTED may be the expected result and may not be an error at all
for that specific UEFI Driver.
Caution: Make sure that all status codes returned by OpenProtocol() are properly evaluated.

AgentHandle and ControllerHandle describe "who" is opening the protocol interface. For UEFI drivers,
the AgentHandle parameter is typically the DriverBindingHandle field from the EFI
DRIVER
BINDING
PROTOCOL
_
_
_
produced by the UEFI Driver. UEFI Drivers that are device drivers producing additional protocols on the
same handle typically use the same value for Handle and ControllerHandle. UEFI Drivers that are bus
drivers producing child handles may use OpenProtocol() with Handle set to the handle for the bus
controller and ControllerHandle set to the handle of a child controller.
The Attributes parameter is a bitmask that describes "why" the protocol interface is being opened. The
# define values used to build an Attributes value are also shown in Example 38 above. They are the
# define statements. A summary of the attribute combinations used by UEFI drivers is listed below .
Caution: Make sure UEFI Drivers use the attributes correctly . If the attributes are used incorrectly, a
driver may not function properly and may cause problems with other drivers. There are UEFI Shell
commands to help verify the proper use of attributes including dh, connect, disconnect, reconnect,
drivers, devices, devtree, and openinfo. EFI

5.1.3 Handle Database and Protocol Services
Caution: It can be dangerous to use this open mode (in which a protocol does not have to be closed)
because a protocol may be removed at any time without notifying the UEFI Driver that used this mode.
This means that a driver using EFIOPEN
PROTOCOL
GET
_
_
_
PROTOCOL may attempt to use a stale
protocol interface pointer that is no longer valid.
_
TIP: Use EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL
B Y
_
_
DRIVER first, to prevent the protocol from being removed while a
_
_
driver is using the protocol.
The EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL
GET
_
_
_
_
PROTOCOL attribute can then be used to retrieve the needed protocol interface.
A UEFI driver should be designed to use EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL
_
_
_
B YDRIVER as its first choice. However, there are
cases where a different UEFI driver has already opened the protocol that is required by
`EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL BY
_
DRIVER. In these cases, use EFIOPEN
PROTOCOL GET
_
PROTOCOL. This scenario may occur when
_
_
_
protocols are layered on top of each other so that each layer uses the services of the layer immediately below. Each layer
immediately below is opened with EFIOPEN
PROTOCOL`B Y
DRIVER.
_
_
If a layer needs to skip a layer to reach a lower-level service, then it is safe to use
EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL
GET
_
_
_
_
PROTOCOL because the driver is informed through the layers if the lower-level
protocol is removed.
The best example of this case in the EDK II is the FA T driver. The FA T driver uses the services of the Disk
I/O Protocol to access the contents of a mass storage device. However, the Disk I/O Protocol does not
have a flush service. Only the Block I/O Protocol has a flush service. The Disk I/O driver opens the Block
I/O Protocol EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL
BY
_
_
_
_
DRIVER , so the FA T driver is also not allowed to open the Block I/O Protocol
EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL
BY
_
_
_
_
DRIVER . Instead, the FA T driver must use EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL
GET
PROTOCOL . This method is safe
_
_
_
_
because the FA T driver is indirectly notified if the Block I/O Protocol is removed when the Disk I/O
Protocol is removed in response to the Block I/O Protocol being removed.

The code fragment in shows the same example as above, but it retrieves the PCI I/O Protocol using the

UEFI Driver no longer requires the services of the PCI I/O Protocol. This example also shows
CloseProtocol() being used to close the protocol, which is commonly found in implementations of
Supported() and Stop() . Notice that the parameters passed to CloseProtocol() are identical to the

control of a serial port even if it is already being used as a console device. If this device is the only console device in th

5.1.3.5 OpenProtocolInformation()
This service retrieves the list of agents currently using a specific protocol interface installed on a handle
in the handle database. An agent may be a UEFI Driver or a UEFI Application using the services of a
protocol interface. The OpenProtocol() service adds agents to the list, and the CloseProtocol() service
removes agents from the list. The return buffer from this service is allocated using AllocatePool() . T o
prevent memory leaks, the caller must free the return buffer with FreePool() when it no longer needs it.
The UEFI Shell command openinfo uses this service to view the results from OpenProtocolInformation()
for any protocol installed into the handle database. It is very useful when debugging UEFI Drivers to
evaluate the state of protocols the drivers consume and produce in the handle database and to verify
that the UEFI Driver is using OpenProtocol() and CloseProtocol() properly .
A UEFI Driver may use this service to find the list of controllers the UEFI Driver is managing or the list of
child handles that the UEFI driver has produced in previous calls to the Start() . A UEFI Driver may also
choose to keep track of this type of information itself and not use the Protocol Handler Services to
retrieve this type of information.
The following code fragment uses LocateHandleBuffer() to retrieve the list of handles that support the PCI
R oot Bridge I/O Protocol. It then uses OpenProtocolInformation() on the first handle that supports the PCI
R oot Bridge I/O Protocol to retrieve information on all the agents that are using that specific PCI R oot
Bridge I/O Protocol instance. This example then loops through all the consumers of that PCI R oot Bridge
I/O Protocol and counts the number of handles that have opened the PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol
instance with an open mode of EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL
BY
CHILD
_
_
_
_
_
CONTROLLER . This open mode indicates that the
agent is a child handle. The result is the total number of PCI controllers that are attached to that
specific PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol instance.

5.1.4 T ask Priority Level(TPL) Services
5.1.4 T ask Priority Level(TPL) Services
The T ask Priority Level Services provide a mechanism for code to execute code at a raised priority for
short periods of time. One use case is a UEFI Driver that is required to raise the priority because the
implementation of a service of a specific protocol requires execution at a specific TPL to be UEFI
conformant. Another use case is a UEFI Driver that needs to implement a simple lock, or critical section,
on global data structures maintained by the UEFI Driver. Event notification functions, covered in the next
section, always execute at raised priority levels.
The service RaiseTPL() is used to raise the priority level from its current level to a higher level and return
the priority level before it was raised. The service RestoreTPL() is used to restore a the priority level to a
priority level returned by RaiseTPL() . These two services are always used in pairs.
Note: There are no UEFI services provided to lower the TPL, and it is illegal to use RaiseTPL() to attempt
to raise the priority level to a level below the current priority level. If attempted, the behavior of the
platform is indeterminate.
The Event, Timer, and T ask Priority Services section of the UEFI Specification defines four TPL levels.
These are TPL
_
APPLICATION , TPL
_
CALLBACK , TPL
_
NOTIFY , and TPL
HIGH
_
_
LEVEL . UEFI Driver and UEFI Applications are
started at TPL
_
APPLICATION . UEFI Drivers should execute code at the lowest possible TPL level and minimiz e
the time spent at raised TPL levels.
Note: Only TPL
_
APPLICATION , TPL
_
CALLBACK , TPL
_
NOTIFY , and TPL
HIGH
_
_
LEVEL may be used by UEFI Drivers. All
other values are reserved for use by the firmware. Using them results in unpredictable behavior. Good
coding practice dictates that all code should execute at its lowest possible TPL level, and the use of TPL
levels above TPL
_
APPLICATION must be minimiz ed. Executing at TPL levels above TPL
APPLICATION for extended
_
periods of time may also result in unpredictable behavior.
UEFI firmware, applications, and drivers all run on one thread on one processor. However, UEFI firmware
does support a single timer interrupt . Because UEFI code can run in interrupt context, it is possible that a
global data structure can be accessed from both normal context and interrupt context. As a result,
global data structures that are accessed from both normal context and interrupt context must be
protected by a lock.
The following code fragment shows how the RaiseTPL() and RestoreTPL() services can be used to
implement a lock when the contents of a global variable are modified. The timer interrupt is blocked at
EFI
TPL
HIGH
_
_
_
LEVEL , so most locks raise to this level.
Example 45-Using TPL S ervices for a Global Lock

EFI
_
TPL OldTpl;

//
// Increment the global variable now that it is safe to do so.
// gCounter++;
//
// Restore the Task Priority Level to its original level
//
gBS->RestoreTPL (OldTpl);
The code fragment in Example 46, below, has the same functionality as Example 45, above, but uses
the lock macros and functions from the EDK II Library UefiLib that use RaiseTPL() and RestoreTPL() to
implement general purpose locks. The global variable gLock is an EFI
LOCK structure that is initializ ed
_
using the EFI
INITIALIZE
LOCK
_
_
_
VARIABLE() macro that specifies the use of TPL
HIGH
_
_
LEVEL when the lock is
acquired. The EfiAcquireLock() and EfiReleaseLock() functions hide the details of managing TPL levels.
Example 46-Using UEFI Library for a Global Lock
# include <Uefi.h>
# include <Library/UefiLib.h>
EFI
_
LOCK gLock = EFI
INITIALIZE
LOCK
_
_
_

UINT32 gCounter;
//
//
// Acquire the lock to block timer interrupts
EfiAcquireLock (&gLock);
//
// Increment the global variable now that it is safe to do so.
// gCounter++;
//
// Release the lock
//
EfiReleaseLock (&gLock);
The algorithm shown in these two global lock examples also applies to a UEFI Driver that is required to
implement protocol services that execute at a specific TPL level. For example, the services in the Block
I/O Protocol must be called at or below TPL
_
CALLBACK . This means that the implementation of the
ReadBlocks() , WriteBlocks() , and FlushBlocks() services should raise the priority level to TPL

5.1.5 Event services
UEFI Boot Services are provided to create, manage, and close UEFI Events. UEFI Drivers may use these
event services for several features that may include the following:
Implementation of protocols that produce an EFI
_
EVENT to inform protocol consumers when input is
available.
Notification when ExitBootServices() is called by an OS Loader or OS K ernel so UEFI Drivers can place
devices in a quiescent state or a state that is required for OS compatibility .
Notification when SetVirtualAddressMap() is called by an OS Loader or OS K ernel so a UEFI R untime Driver
can translate physical addresses to virtual addresses.
Timer events used to periodically poll for I/O completion and/or detect timeout conditions.
Implementation of protocols that provide non-blocking I/O capabilities where notification of an I/O
completion utiliz es an EFI
EVENT .
_
5.1.5.1 CreateEvent(), CreateEventEx(), and CloseEvent()
The CreateEvent(), CreateEventEx(), and CloseEvent() services are used to create and close events. The
following two basic types of events can be created:
EVT
NOTIFY
SIGNAL
_
_
EVT
NOTIFY
WAIT
_
_
The type of event determines when an event's notification function is invoked. The notification function
for signal type events is invoked when an event is placed into the signaled state with a call to
SignalEvent() . The notification function for wait type events is invoked when the event is passed to the
CheckEvent() or WaitForEvent() services.
UEFI Drivers that produce protocols providing an EFI
_
EVENT field to indicate when input is available are
required to create events of type EVT
NOTIFY
_
_
WAIT . Consumers of these protocols may use CheckEvent() or
WaitForEvent() to check when input is available.
Protocols from the UEFI Specification containing this use case include the Simple T ext Input Protocols,
the Pointer Protocols, and the Simple Network Protocol. The complete list follows:

Some UEFI drivers are required to place their controllers in a quiescent state or perform other
controller-specific actions when an operating system is about to take full control of the platform. In this
case, the UEFI driver should create a signal type event that is notified when ExitBootServices() is called by
the operating system.
UEFI R untime Drivers may need to be notified when SetVirtualAddressMap() is called to convert physical
addresses to virtual addresses. A complete example for this use case, including the use of
CreateEventEx() , is shown in Section 5.2.9.

5.1.5 Event services
UEFI Drivers may use timer events to periodically poll for device status changes, poll for an I/O
completion or detect timeouts. A complete example showing how to create periodic and one-shot timer
events using CreateEventEx() is provided in Section 5.1.6.
Note:
_
If a UEFI Driver creates events in its driver entry point, those events must be closed with
CloseEvent() in the UEFI Driver's Unload() function.
Note: If a UEFI Driver creates events in its Driver Binding Protocol Start() function associated with a
device, those events must be closed with CloseEvent() in its Driver Binding Protocol Stop() function.
Note: If a UEFI Driver creates events as part of an I/O operation, the event should be closed with
CloseEvent() when the I/O operation is completed.
Caution: If the CloseEvent() service is not used to close events created with CreateEvent() or
CreateEventEx() ,the event consumes memory and generates a memory leak.
_
The code fragment below shows an example of a wait event created by a keyboard driver producing the
EFI
SIMPLE
TEXT

_
_
_
_
_
PROTOCOL . The first part of the code fragment is the event notification function plus
an internal worker function that are called when the status of the wait event is checked with the
CheckEvent() or the WaitForEvent() services. The second part of the code fragment is the code from the
Driver Binding Protocol Start() and Stop() functions that create and close the wait event. T ypically, a
UEFI application or the UEFI boot manager call CheckEvent() or WaitForEvent() to see if a key has been
pressed on a input device that supports the Simple T ext Input Ex Protocol. This call to CheckEvent() or
WaitForEvent() causes the notification function of the wait event in the Simple T ext Input Ex Protocol to be
executed. The notification function checks to see if a key has been pressed on the input device. If the
key has been pressed, the wait event is signaled with a call to SignalEvent() . If the wait event is signaled,
the UEFI application or UEFI boot manager then receives an EFI
SUCCESS return code and the UEFI

application or UEFI boot manager calls the ReadKeyStroke() service of the EFI

The code fragment in the following example shows how an Exit Boot Services event is created using
CreateEvent() and closed using CloseEvent() . In this example, the EFI
_
EVENT is a global variable. This is the
typical implementation for a UEFI Driver because events of this type are usually created in the Driver
Binding Protocol Start() function and closed in the Driver Binding Protocol Stop() function, and the
global variable provides an easy method to close the event in the Driver Binding Protocol Stop()
function.
This example also contains the function NotifyExitBootService() , a template for the event notification
function. It should contain the set of UEFI Driver specific actions that must be performed when the OS
Load or OS K ernel calls ExitBootServices() . This notification function is registered in the call to
CreateEvent() . The execution priority level is TPL
_
NOTIFY and the NotifyContext is NULL in this example.
Caution: The notification function for ExitBootServices() is not allowed to use any of the UEFI Memory
Services, either directly or indirectly, because using those services may modify the UEFI Memory Map
and force an error to be returned from ExitBootServices(). An OS loader or OS K ernel that calls
ExitBootServices() needs to know the state of the memory map at the time ExitBootServices() was
called. The OS loader retrieves the current state of the memory map by calling GetMemoryMap() . If events
registered on ExitBootServices() perform memory allocation or free calls, the memory map may be
modified, and may cause incorrect memory map information to be used by the OS. The UEFI memory
manager detects when the memory map is modified, so the OS loader always knows that the memory
map was not modified if ExitBootServices() returns EFISUCCESS. If the memory map was modified, the OS
loader must call GetMemoryMap() again to get the current memory map state, and then retry a call to
ExitBootServices(). The modified state is cleared during the call to GetMemoryMap().

The following code fragment has the same functionality as Example 48, above, but uses
CreateEventEx() instead of CreateEvent() to create an event that is signaled when
ExitBootServices() is called. CreateEventEx() supports event groups that are named by GUID.
The Event, Timer , and T ask Priority Services section of the UEFI Specification defines a set of
event group GUIDs that are defined in the EDK II in the MdePkg include file <Guid/EventGuid.h> .
Caution: CreateEventEx() allows creation of more than one timer event associated with the same event
group GUID. Because there is no mechanism for determining which of the timer events associated with
the same event group GUID was signaled, it is recommended that timer events be created with
CreateEvent() or with CreateEventEx() using a NULL EventGroup.

Example 49, above, shows how the CreateEventEx() function is used to create an event that is notified
when an event group named by GUID is signaled. In this case, notification functions are called when the
OS Loader or OS K ernel calls ExitBootServices() . CreateEventEx() also supports creating an event for an
event group named by GUID that causes all the event notification functions associated with that same
event group to be executed when the event is signaled with SignalEvent() .
The example below shows the simplest method of creating, signaling, and closing an event group
named by gEfiExampleEventGroupGuid . Notice that T ype is 0 and no notification function, TPL, or context is
specified. Since use of this mechanism is usually in cases where one UEFI image needs to signal events
in other UEFI images, this specific usage of CreateEventEx() is rarely used by UEFI Drivers.

5.1.5.2 SignalEvent()
This service places an event in the signaled state. Use SignalEvent() in implementations of protocols
containing an EFI

Protocols, and the Simple Network Protocol. The complete list follows:

when a key press has been detected. The function KeyboardCheckForKey() is a hardware specific function
that returns EFI
_
SUCCESS if a key has been pressed. It returns an error code if a key has not been
pressed. The check is performed at TPL
_
NOTIFY to guarantee that hardware action checking for a key
press is atomic.

5.1.6 SetTimer()
5.1.6 SetTimer()
This service programs a timer event to be signaled in the future. The time is specified in 100
nanosecond (ns) units. UEFI supports both periodic timer events and one-shot timer events. Use these
timer events when polling for I/O completions, detecting hot plug events, detecting timeout conditions
for I/O operations, supporting asynchronous I/O operations, etc.
Caution : The units used for timer events may appear to have better accuracy than the Stall() service,
which has an accuracy of 1 μs, but that may not be the case. UEFI uses a single timer interrupt to
determine when to signal timer events. The resolution of timer events is dependent on the frequency of
the timer interrupt.
UEFI system firmware uses a hardware timer interrupt to measure time. These. These time
measurements are used to determine when enough time has passed to signal a timer event
programmed with SetTimer() . In most systems, the timer interrupt is generated every 10 ms to 50 ms,
but the UEFI Specification does not require any specific interrupt rate. This lack of specificity means that
a periodic timer programmed with a period much smaller than 10 ms may only be signaled every 10 ms
to 50 ms. If short delays much smaller than 10 ms are required, use the Stall() service.
TIP: Timer event services are not accurate over short delays. If a short, accurate delay, is required then
the Stall() service should be used.
The code fragment in Example 53 shows how to create a timer event and program it as a periodic timer
with a period of 100 ms. When the created event is signaled every 100 ms, the notification function
TimerHandler() is called at TPL
NOTIFY with the EXAMPLE
_
_
DEVICE context that was registered when the event
was created. The EDK II library UefiLib provides macros for the timer periods used with the SetTimer()
services.
These macros include EFI
TIMER
PERIOD
_
_
_
MICROSECONDS() , EFI
TIMER
PERIOD
_
_
_
MILLISECONDS() , and EFI
TIMER
PERIOD
_
_
_
SECONDS()
The Private Context Structure a UEFI Driver uses to store device specific information usually contains
EFI
EVENT fields for the events the UEFI Driver creates. This allows a UEFI Driver to close events when a
_
device is stopped or when a UEFI Driver is unloaded. In this example, the Private Context Structure
called EXAMPLE
DEVICE contains an EFI
_
_
EVENT for both a periodic and a one-shot timer. The Private Context
Structure is also typically passed in as the Context parameter when an event is created. This provides
the event notification function with the device specific context required to perform the device specific
actions.
Caution : Always close timer events with the UEFI Boot Service CloseEvent() whenever a device is stopped
or a UEFI Driver is unloaded. If not performed, a call for an event notification no longer present in
memory, or event notification function for a device no longer available, may cause unexpected failures.

5.1.7 Stall()
5.1.7 Stall()
The Stall() service waits for a specified number of microseconds. In 32-bit environments, the range of
supported delays is from 1 μs to a little over an hour. In 64-bit execution environments, the range of
supported delays is from 1uS to about 500,000 years. However, the delays passed into this service
should be short and are typically in the range of a few microseconds to a few milliseconds.
Caution: Implementations of the Stall() service may disable interrupts and may block execution of
other UEFI drivers. If long delays are required, use a Timer Event instead. See CreateEvent() ,

The Stall() service is very accurate and typically uses a high frequency hardware timer or a calibrated
software delay loop to implement the stall functionality .
Caution: Stall() may use a different timing source than the event timer, and may have a higher or
lower frequency and, hence, different accuracy .
For hardware devices requiring delays between register accesses, use the Stall() service. with a fixed
stall value based in a hardware specification for the device being accessed. The following example
shows a use-case to perform a fixed delay of 10 us between two PCI MMIO register writes.

5.2.1 ConnectController() and DisconnectController()
5.2.1 ConnectController() and DisconnectController()
These services request UEFI Drivers to start or stop managing controllers in a platform. They are
typically used by the UEFI Boot Manager to connect the devices required to boot an operating system.
These services may also be used by a UEFI Boot Manager to connect all devices in the platform if the
user chooses to enter platform setup. OS Loaders and OS Installers may also use these services to
connect additional devices required to complete an OS boot or OS installation operation.
Additionally, UEFI applications, such as the UEFI Shell, may use these services to test the functionality of
a UEFI Driver under test. The UEFI Shell commands using these services are connect , disconnect , and
reconnect . A common test sequence a UEFI Driver developer may use to test the functionality of a new
UEFI Driver is:
Load the UEFI Driver.
Connect the UEFI Driver.
T est functionality of protocols produced by the UEFI Driver.
Disconnect the UEFI Driver.
Unload the UEFI Driver.
Fix known issues with the UEFI Driver and repeat.
The use of ConnectController() and DisconnectController() in UEFI Driver implementations is less common and
is usually restricted to UEFI Drivers managing hot-plug capable busses and unloadable UEFI Drivers.
5.2.1.1 Hot Plug Operations
T o facilitate a hot-add operation on a hot-plug capable bus, use ConnectController() to connect UEFI
Drivers to the hot-added device. Likewise, to facilitate a hot-remove operation on a hot-plug capable
bus, use DisconnectController() to request that UEFI Drivers stop managing the removed device. Just
because a bus is capable of supporting hot-plug events does not necessarily mean that the UEFI driver
for that bus type must support those hot-plug events. Support for hot-plug events in the pre-boot
environment is dependent on the platform requirements for each bus type.
The best example of the hot-plug this use case in the EDK II is the USB Bus Driver in
MdeModulePkg/Bus/Usb/UsbBusDxe . The USB bus driver in the EDK II does not create any child handles in its
Driver Binding Protocol Start() function. Instead, it registers a periodic timer event.
When the timer period expires, the timer event's notification function is called and that notification
function examines all USB root ports and USB hubs to see if any USB devices have been added or
removed. If a USB device is added, a child handle is created with a Device Path Protocol and a USB I/O
Protocol. ConnectController() is then called to allow USB device drivers to connect to the newly added USB
device. If a USB device has been removed, DisconnectController() is called to stop the USB device drivers
from managing the removed USB device.
The following code fragment shows how ConnectController() is used to perform a recursive connect
operation in response to a hot-add operation.

5.2.1.2 Driver Unload Operations
Use the DisconnectController() service, from unloadable UEFI drivers, to disconnect the UEFI driver from the
device(s) it is managing. The DisconnectController() service is called from the Unload() function that is
registered in the Loaded Image Protocol for the UEFI Driver
The following code fragment shows a simple algorithm that a UEFI Driver can use to disconnect the UEFI
Driver from all the devices in the system that it is currently managing.
It first retrieves the list of all the handles in the handle database, then disconnects the UEFI driver from
each of those handles.
A UEFI Driver could implement a more efficient algorithm if the UEFI Driver kept a list of the controller
handles it manages. It could then call DisconnectController() for each of the controller handles in that list.

5.2.2 R einstallProtocolInterface()
5.2.2 ReinstallProtocolInterface()
This service should be used only to indicate media change events and when a device path is modified or
updated. Some examples of when this service must be used are: - A UEFI Driver that produces the Block
I/O Protocol for a removable media device when the media in a removable media device is changed (i.e.
Floppy, CD, DVD).
A UEFI Driver that produces the Serial I/O Protocol when the attributes are modified using
SetAttributes()
A UEFI Driver that produces the Simple Network Protocol when the MAC address of the network
interface is modified using StationAddress() .
Internally, this service performs the following series of actions:
1. UninstallProtocolInterface() , which may cause DisconnectController() to be called
2. InstallProtocolInterface()
3. ConnectController() to allow controllers that had to release the protocol a chance to connect to it
again
Caution: This service may induce reentrancy if a driver makes a request that requires a UEFI
Driver for a parent device to call ReinstallProtocolInterface() . In this case, the driver making the request
may not realiz e that the request causes the driver to be completely stopped and completely restarted
when the request to the parent device is made.
For example, consider a terminal driver that wants to change the baud rate on the serial port. The baud
rate is changed with a call to the Serial I/O Protocol's
SetAttributes() . This call changes the baud rate, which is reflected in the device path of the serial device,
so the Device Path Protocol is reinstalled by the SetAttributes() service. This reinstallation forces the
terminal driver to be disconnected. The terminal driver then attempts to connect to the serial device
again, but the baud rate is the one that the terminal driver expects, so the terminal driver does not
need to set the baud rate again.
Any consumer of a protocol that supports this media change concept needs to be aware that the
protocol can be reinstalled at any time and that care must be taken in the design of drivers that use
this type of protocol.
The following code fragments in Example 61 show what a UEFI driver that produces the Block I/O
Protocol should do when the media in a removable media device is changed. The exact same protocol is
reinstalled onto the controller handle. The specific action that detects if the media is not included in
this code fragment. The original Block I/O Media structure is copied so it can be compared with the
Block I/O Media structure after the media change detection logic is executed. The Block I/O Protocol is
reinstalled if the Media ID is different, if the siz e of blocks on the mass storage device has changed, if
the number of blocks on the mass storage device has changed, if the present status has changed, or if
the media has changed from read-only to read-write or vice versa.

5.2.3 LocateDevicePath()
5.2.3 LocateDevicePath()
This service locates a device handle that supports a specific protocol and has the closest matching
device path. Although a rare requirement, it is useful when a UEFI Driver needs to find an I/O abstraction
for one of its parent controllers.
Normally, a UEFI Driver uses the services on the ControllerHandle that is passed into the Supported() and
Start() functions of the EFI driver's EFI
DRIVER
BINDING
_
_
_
PROTOCOL . However, if a UEFI Driver does require the
use of services from a parent controller, LocateDevicePath() can be used to find the handle of a parent
controller.
For example, a PCI device driver normally uses the PCI I/O Protocol to manage a PCI controller.
Hypothetically, if a PCI device driver required the services of the PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol of which the
PCI controller is a child, then the gBS->LocateDevicePath() function can be used to find the parent handle
that supports the PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol. Then the gBS->OpenProtocol() service can be used to
retrieve the PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol interface from that handle.
The code fragment below shows how a UEFI Driver for a PCI Controller can retrieve the PCI R oot Bridge
I/O Protocol of which the PCI controller is a child.
Caution: This operation is provided only as an illustration and is not recommended because a parent
bus driver typically owns the parent I/O abstractions. Directly using a parent I/O may cause unintended
side effects.
Section 18.4.2, Example 175, contains another example showing the recommended method for a PCI
driver to access the resources of other PCI controllers on the same PCI adapter without using the PCI
R oot Bridge I/O Protocol.

5.2.4 LoadImage() and StartImage()
5.2.4 LoadImage() and StartImage()
Use LoadImage() to load and relocate a UEFI Image into system memory, and prepare it for execution. Use
StartImage() to transfer control to a UEFI Image that was previously loaded into system memory using
LoadImage() . These services are typically used by the UEFI Boot Manager when processing load options
for UEFI Drivers, UEFI Applications, or UEFI OS Loaders. UEFI drivers do not typically need to load other
UEFI Drivers and/or UEFI applications.
One exception is a bus driver for a bus type that provides a storage container for UEFI Drivers and/or
UEFI Applications. A PCI Option ROM is an example of a container with those attributes. A PCI Bus Driver
is required to discover any PCI Option ROM containers present on PCI Adapters. If a PCI Option ROM
contains one or more UEFI Drivers that are compatible with the currently executing CPU, then the PCI
Bus Driver is required to load and start those UEFI Drivers using the LoadImage() and StartImage() services.
The EDK II PCI Bus Driver that performs this operation can be found in MdeModulePkg/Bus/Pci/PciBusDxe .
Another exception is a UEFI Driver that needs to execute a UEFI Application for the purposes of
extended diagnostics or to augment driver configuration. There are UEFI standard methods for a UEFI
Driver to provide diagnostics and configuration through the use of the EFI
DRIVER
DIAGNOSTICS2
PROTOCOL and
_
_
_
HII. If for some reason, a UEFI Driver requires diagnostics or configuration capabilities that cannot be
expressed using these standard methods, a UEFI Driver could choose to execute a UEFI Application that
provides those capabilities. In the case of a PCI Adapter, UEFI Applications could be stored in the PCI
Option ROM container. The UEFI Driver would use the LoadImage() and StartImage() services to load and
execute those UEFI Applications from that container.
The following code fragment in Example 64 shows an example of a UEFI Driver for a PCI controller that
uses the LoadImage() and StartImage() service to load and execute a 32 KB UEFI Application that is stored
32 KB into the PCI Option ROM container associated with the PCI controller. PciControllerHandle is the
EFI
HANDLE for the PCI Controller.
_
This example retrieves both the PCI I/O Protocol and the Device Path Protocol associated with
PciControllerHandle . The Device Path Protocol is used to construct a proper device path for the UEFI
Application stored in the PCI option ROM. Helper functions from the EDK II library DevicePathLib are used
to fill in the contents of a new device path node for the UEFI Application stored in the PCI Option ROM
and to append that device path node to the device path of the PCI controller. Use the PCI I/O Protocol to
access the shadowed copy of the PCI Option ROM contents through the RomImage field. The shadowed
copy of the PCI Option ROM was created when the PCI bus was enumerated and the PCI I/O Protocols
were produced.
Note: The use of a 32 KB offset and 32 KB length simplifies this example. An addin adapter that stores
UEFI Applications in a PCI Option ROM container would likely define vendor specific descriptors to
determine the offset and siz e of one or more UEFI Applications.

5.2.5 GetV ariable() and SetV ariable()
5.2.5 GetV ariable() and SetV ariable()
Use GetVariable() and SetVariable() services to read and write UEFI variables. UEFI Drivers for add-in
adapters, such as PCI adapters, should not use these services to access configuration information for
the adapter. Instead, the add-in adapter should provide its own local storage for configuration
information. UEFI Drivers provided with UEFI system firmware use UEFI variables to store configuration
information. Examples found in the EDK II of UEFI Drivers use UEFI variables to store configuration
information include the IPv4 and IPv6 network stacks in the MdeModulePkg/Universal/Network and the NetworkPkg .
Caution: Add-in cards should not store their configuration via variables. When the card is removed from
the system, the variables related to its configuration become ownerless. There is no way to safely
recover that data. In addition, it is impossible for the system designer to determine the amount of
configuration data each card consumes. As such, there may simply not be enough space to store the
configuration in a particular system's variable space. T o ensure proper function, each card must store
its own configuration on the add-in card.
A UEFI V ariable is specified with a combination of a GUID and a Unicode string. The GUID prevents name
collisions between different vendors. Each vendor may create GUIDs for their own storage and manage

The variable is available for read and write access in both the pre-boot environment and the OS
runtime environment and the contents are persistent across system resets and power cycles.
These types of variables are typically used to share persistent information among pre-boot

A UEFI Driver that is required to use UEFI variables to store configuration information typically accesses
those UEFI variables in the implementation of the services provided by a EFI

_
ACCESS is used to store configuration
information that persists across resets and power cycles. It also allows for updates to this configuration
information from operating systems that provide support for OS-present configuration changes using

The attribute of BOOTSERVICE
ACCESS should be used with a UEFI variable used as a mailbox to store state
_
information that is required by multiple HII forms or multiple HII callbacks.
The following code fragment shows how to write a configuration structure to a UEFI variable whose

5.2.8 CalculateCrc32()
Use this service to maintain the checksums in the UEFI System T able, UEFI boot services table, and UEFI
runtime services table. A UEFI driver that modifies one of these tables should use this service to update
the checksums. A UEFI driver could compute the 32-bit CR C on its own, but the UEFI driver is smaller if it
takes advantage of this UEFI boot service. This service can also be used to compute the checksums in
Guided Partition T able(GPT) structures.
The following code fragment shows how CalculateCrc32() can be used to calculate and update the 32-bit
CR C field in the UEFI System T able header. The EDK II library UefiBootServicesTableLib provides global
variables for the UEFI System T able, the UEFI Boot Services T able, and the Image Handle for the currently
executing driver. In this example, the global variable for the UEFI System T able called gST and the global
variable for the UEFI Boot Services T able called gBS are used to reference the UEFI System T able header
and call the UEFI Boot Services CalculateCrc32() . Since the CR C32 field is part of the structure for which
the 32-bit CR C is being computed, it must be set to z ero before calling CalculateCrc32() .
Example 71-Calculate and update 32-bit CRC in UEFI S ystem Table
# include <Uefi.h>

&gST->Hdr.CRC32
);
if (EFI
_
ERROR (Status)) {
return Status;
}
The code fragment below shows how to calculate a 32-bit CR C for an EXAMPLE
DEVICE structure. Since the
_
computed 32-bit CR C is not stored within the EXAMPLE
_
DEVICE structure, it does not need to be z eroed
before calling the CalculateCrc32() service.

The CalculateCrc32() service can also be used to verify a 32-bit CR C value. The code fragment below
shows how the 32-bit CR C for the UEFI System T able header can be verified. This algorithm preserves the
original contents of the UEFI System T able header. It returns TRUE if the 32-bit CR C is good. Otherwise, it

5.2.9 ConvertPointer()
5.2.9 ConvertPointer()
UEFI Boot Service drivers must never use this service.
This service may be required by UEFI R untime Drivers if the UEFI R untime Driver is required to convert
pointer values that use physical addresses to pointer values that use virtual addresses. A UEFI R untime
driver must only call ConvertPointer() from an event notification function for an event of type
EVT
SIGNAL
VIRTUAL
ADDRESS
_
_
_
_
CHANGE or a GUIDed event of type EFI
EVENT
GROUP
VIRTUAL
ADDRESS
_
_
_
_
_
CHANGE .
Caution: Notification functions for events signaled when SetVirtualAddressMap() is called by an OS
Loader or OS K ernel are not allowed to use any of the UEFI boot services, UEFI Console Services, or UEFI
Protocol Services either directly or indirectly because those services are no longer available when
SetVirtualAddressMap() is called. Instead, this type of notification function typically uses ConvertPointer() to
convert pointers within data structures that are managed by the UEFI runtime driver from physical
addresses to virtual addresses.
UEFI system firmware takes care of most of the physical to virtual address translations that a UEFI
R untime Driver requires. For example, all of the code and data sections in the UEFI R untime Driver image
are automatically fixed up for proper execution at the virtual address ranges provided by the operating
system when the operating system calls the UEFI R untime Service SetVirtualAddressMap() .
If a UEFI R untime Driver caches pointer values in global variables, or a UEFI R untime Driver allocates
buffers from EfiRuntimeServicesData , those pointer values must be converted from physical addresses to
virtual address using the virtual address ranges provided by the operating system when the operating
system calls the UEFI R untime Service SetVirtualAddressMap() . If allocated buffers contain more pointers,
then those pointer values must also be converted.
In these more complex scenarios, the order of the conversions is critical because the algorithm in the
UEFI R untime Driver must guarantee that no virtual addresses in the execution of the notification
actually function because the event notification function on SetVirtualAddressMap() only executes in
physical mode.
The following code fragment shows how a UEFI R untime Driver can create an event whose notification
function is executed in physical mode when the OS Loader or OS K ernel calls SetVirtualAddressMap() . There
are two methods to create a SetVirtualAddressMap() event. This example shows the preferred method that
uses CreateEventEx() to pass in the GUID of gEfiEventVirtualAddressChangeGuid . The alternate method uses
CreateEvent() or CreateEventEx() with an event type of EVT
SIGNAL
VIRTUAL
ADDRESS
CHANGE . The created event is
_
_
_
_
declared as a global variable. and makes the event available if the UEFI R untime Driver needs to close
the event if UEFI R untime Driver is unloaded. The code fragments that follow this example show how
ConvertPointer() may be used from NotifySetVirtualAddressMap() , the event notification function from this
example.

5.2.9 ConvertPointer()
Example 76-Using UefiRuntimeLib to convert a pointer
The EDK II library UefiRuntimeLib also provides the function EfiConvertFunctionPointer() to convert a function
pointer from a physical address to a virtual address. On supported CPU architectures where there is no
distinction between a data pointer and a function pointer, EfiConvertPointer() and EfiConvertFunctionPointer()
are identical. On other CPU architectures such as IPF, where function calls are made through a PLABEL ,
converting a function pointer is more complex. The EDK II library UefiRuntimeLib helps hide these CPU
specific details so the UEFI Driver sources can be the same for all supported CPU architectures.
Since the UEFI system firmware automatically converts functions in code sections of a UEFI R untime
Driver image from physical addresses to virtual addresses, EfiConvertFunctionPointer() is required only if a
UEFI Driver caches a function pointer in a global variable or an allocated buffer.
Example 77-Using UefiRuntimeLib to convert a function pointer

(VOID**)&gGlobalFunctionPointer
);
}
The EDK II library UefiRuntimeLib also provides helper function call EfiConvertList() to convert all the pointer
values in a doubly linked list of type LIST
ENTRY . All the nodes in the linked list are traversed and the
_
forward and backward link in each node is converted from a physical address to a virtual address.
Once this conversion is performed, the linked list cannot be accessed again in this function because all
the pointer values are now virtual addresses. If the contents of the linked list contain structures with
more pointer values that also need to be converted, those conversions must be performed prior to
calling EfiConvertList() .

5.2.10 InstallConfigurationT able()
This service is used to add, update, or remove an entry in the list of configuration table entries
maintained in the UEFI System T able. These entries are typically used to pass information from the UEFI
pre-boot environment to the operating system environment.
The configuration table entries are composed of a GUID and a pointer to a buffer. The GUID defines the
type of memory that the buffer must use. If an operating system requires a configuration table entry
that is allocated from a memory type that is not preserved after ExitBootServices() , then the OS Loader or
OS K ernel must make a copy of the data structure prior calling ExitBootServices() .
A UEFI Driver has a limited set of options to pass information into the operating system environment.
These include:
Protocols
UEFI V ariables
Configuration T able Entries
The services required to locate protocols in the Handle Database are not available after
ExitBootServices() , so information passed up through protocols must be located by the OS Loader or OS
K ernel prior to calling ExitBootServices() . UEFI V ariables are good for small amounts of data, but may
consume the scarce variable resources and access to variable storage may be slower than system
memory . A configuration table entry is good for larger amounts of data generated each boot and it is
stored in system memory . The UEFI Specification defines a set of GUIDs for standard configuration table
entries that includes:
ACPI T ables
SMBIOS T ables
SAL System T able (IPF only)
MPS T ables
Debug Image Info T ables
Image Execution Information T able
Exported HII Database
User Information T able
Capsules
UNDI Configuration T able
Most of these usages are handled by the UEFI system firmware. The one usage impacting UEFI Drivers is
the UNDI Configuration T able that is produced by a UEFI UNDI Driver for a Network Interface Controller
(NIC). UEFI Drivers are allowed to define new GUIDs for new configuration table entries to pass
information from the UEFI pre-boot environment to the OS environment.
The following code fragment shows how an UNDI driver can add or update an UNDI Configuration T able
entry to the list of configuration table entries maintained in the UEFI System T able.

This service stops execution until an event is signaled and is only allowed to be called at a priority level

because event notification functions always execute at priority levels above TPL

from a device such as a keyboard or mouse as part of a user interface. There are a few older protocols
that UEFI Drivers may produce that interact with the user and the implementation of these protocols
could use WaitForEvent() . For example, the SetOptions() function in the Driver Configuration Protocol.
The following code fragment shows how WaitForEvent() is used to wait for one of two events to be
signaled. One event is signaled if a key is pressed on the console input device from the UEFI System

5.2.11 GetNextMonotonicCount()
This service provides a 64-bit monotonically increasing counter that is guaranteed to provide a higher
value each time GetNextMonotonicCount() is called. This 64-bit counter is not related to any time source, so
this service should never be used for delays, polling, or for any type of time measurement.
GetNextHighMonotonicCount() is related to this same 64-bit monotonic counter, but that service is only
intended to be used by operating systems after ExitBootServices() is called to manage the non-volatile
upper 32-bits of the 64-bit monotonic counter. A UEFI Driver should only use the UEFI Boot Service
GetNextMonotonicCount() because it manages all 64-bits of the monotonic counter before ExitBootServices() is
called.

5.3.8 GetNextV ariableName()
This service is used to traverse the list of UEFI variables that are maintained through the UEFI V ariable
Services. Since, in general, UEFI drivers know the specific UEFI variables that the UEFI Driver is required
to access, there is no need for a UEFI driver to traverse the list of all the UEFI variables. This service is

5.3.11 GetMemoryMap()
5.3.11 GetMemoryMap()
UEFI drivers should not use this service because UEFI drivers should not depend upon the physical
memory map of the platform. The AllocatePool() and AllocatePages() services allow a UEFI driver to allocate
system memory . The FreePool() and FreePages() services allow an UEFI driver to free previously allocated
memory .
If there are limitations on the memory areas that a specific device may use, then those limitations
should be managed by a parent I/O abstraction that understands the details of the platform hardware.
For example, PCI device drivers should use the services of the PCI I/O Protocol to manage DMA buffers.
The PCI I/O Protocol is produced by the PCI bus driver that uses the services if the PCI R oot Bridge I/O
Protocol to manage DMA buffers. The PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol is chipset and platform specific, so
the component that produces the PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol understands what memory regions can
be used for DMA operations. By pushing the responsibility into the chipset- and platform-specific
components, the PCI device drivers and PCI bus drivers are easier to implement and are portable across
a wide variety of platforms.
This service is typically used by a UEFI OS Loader to retrieve the memory map just before the OS takes
control of the platform by calling ExitBootServices() . It may also be used by UEFI applications, such as
diagnostics or debug utilities, to show how platform memory has been allocated.

5.3.17 Exit()
5.3.17 Exit()
The Exit() service is typically only used by UEFI applications. UEFI drivers usually have simple driver
entry point implementations and typically return an EFI
_
STATUS code from their entry point function. This
is the recommended style for UEFI driver implementations. If EFI
_
SUCCESS is returned by a UEFI driver, then
the UEFI driver remains loaded in system memory . If an error status is returned, then the UEFI driver is
unloaded from system memory .
The Exit() service allows a UEFI image to exit without having to return an EFI
STATUS value from the UEFI
_
image's entry point. A UEFI driver with more complex logic in its entry point may discover a condition that
requires the UEFI driver to exit immediately . In this rare condition, the Exit() service could be used.
However, the UEFI driver implementation must take care to free any allocated resources and uninstall
all protocols before returning an error code through the Exit() service. The following example shows
how the Exit() service could be used by a UEFI driver to exit with a status code of EFI
UNSUPPORTED . The
_
EDK II library UefiBootServicesTableLib provides the global gBS ―a pointer to the UEFI Boot Services T able
and gImageHandle ―the Image Handle of the currently executing UEFI image.
Example 85-Exit from a UEFI Driver
# include <Uefi.h>
# include <Library/UefiBootServicesTableLib.h>
//
// Exit the current UEFI image with a status of EFI

There are no use cases for this service by a UEFI Driver. It should never be called.
This service is only used by operating systems to manage the upper 32-bits of the 64-bit monotonic
counter after the operating system has called ExitBootServices() . An operating system that chooses to
use the UEFI provided 64-bit monotonic counter should acquire the value of the 64-bit monotonic
counter before ExitBootServices() using the UEFI Boot Service GetNextMonotonicCount() . The operating system
can manage the volatile lower 32-bits of the 64-bit monotonic counter on its own. If a 32bit rollover
condition occurs, then the operating system can use the UEFI R untime Service GetNextHighMonotonicCount()
to increment the upper 32-bits of the 64-bit monotonic counter. The upper 32-bits are non-volatile and
it is the responsibility of the UEFI firmware to guarantee that the upper 32-bits of the 64-bit monotonic
counter are preserved across system resets and power cycles.

The driver entry point is responsible for installing the Driver Binding Protocol onto the driver's image

However, there are advantages if a driver produces multiple instances of the Driver Binding Protocol.
First, it may reduce the overall siz e of the drivers. If two related drivers are combined, and those two
drivers can share internal functions, the executable image siz e of the single driver may be smaller than
the sum of the two individual drivers.
Combining drivers can also help manage platform features. A single platform's features may require
several drivers. If the drivers are separate, multiple drivers have to be dealt with individually to add or
remove that single feature.

6.1.5 Device drivers with multiple driver binding protocols
An example device driver in EDK II that produces multiple instances of the Driver Binding Protocol is the
console platform driver in the MdeModulePkg/Universal/Console/ConPlatformDxe subdirectory . This driver implements
the platform policy for managing multiple console input and output devices. It produces one Driver
Binding Protocol for the console output devices, and another Driver Binding Protocol for the console
input devices. The management of console devices needs to be centraliz ed, so it makes sense to
combine these two functions into a single driver so the platform vendor needs to update only one driver
to adjust the platform policy for managing console devices.

6.1.6 Device driver protocol management
Device drivers consume one or more I/O-related protocols and use the services of those protocols to
produce one or more I/O-related protocols. The Supported() and Start() functions of the Driver Binding
Protocol are responsible for opening the I/Orelated protocols being consumed using the EFI Boot
Service OpenProtocol() . The Stop() function is responsible for closing the consumed I/O-related protocols
using CloseProtocol() .
A protocol can be opened in several different modes, but the most common is EFI

When a protocol is opened by EFI

The following figure shows the image handle for a device driver as LoadImage() and StartImage() are called.
In addition, it shows the states of three different controller handles as the Driver Binding Protocol
services Supported() , Start() , and Stop() are called. Controller Handle 1 and Controller Handle 3 pass the
Supported() test, so the Start() function can be called. In this case, the Supported() service tests to see if
the controller handle supports Protocol A. Start() is then called for Controller Handle 1 and Controller Handle
3 . In the Start() function, Protocol A is opened EFI

DRIVER , and Protocol B is installed onto
the same controller handle. The implementation of Protocol B uses the services of Protocol A to produce
the services of Protocol B .
All drivers that follow the UEFI driver model must support the Stop() service. The Stop() service must put
the handles back into their previous state, before Start() was called, so the Stop() service uninstalls
Protocol B and closes Protocol A .

The figure below shows a more complex device driver that requires Protocol A and Protocol B to produce
Protocol C . Notice that the controller handles that do not support either Protocol A or Protocol B do not
pass the Supported() test. In addition, controller handles that only support Protocol A or only Protocol B
also do not pass the Supported() test. Finally, note that Controller Handle 6 already has Protocol A opened

support for a specific controller handle.

TIP: The best way to design the algorithm for the opening protocols is to write a Boolean expression for
the protocols that a device driver consumes. Then, expand this Boolean expression into the sum of
products form. Each product in the expanded expression requires its own Driver Binding Protocol.
This scenario is another way that a device driver may be required to produce multiple instances of the
Driver Binding Protocol. The Supported() service for each Driver Binding Protocol attempts to open each
protocol in a product term. If any of those open operations fail, then Supported() fails. If all the opens
succeed, then the Supported() test passes. The Start() function should open each protocol in the
product term, and the Stop() function should close each protocol in the product term.

6.2.5 Bus driver protocol and child management
The management of I/O-related protocols by a bus driver is very similar to the management of I/O-related
protocol for device drivers described in Section 6.1.6. A bus driver opens one or more I/O-related
protocols on the controller handle for the bus controller, creates one or more child handles and installs
one or more I/O-related protocols. If the child handle represents a physical device, a Device Path
Protocol must also be installed onto the child handle. The child handle is also required to open the
parent I/O protocol with an attribute of EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL
BY
CHILD
_
_
_
_
_
CONTROLLER .
Some types of bus drivers can produce a single child handle each time Start() is called, but only if the
R emainingDevicePath passed into Start() represents a valid child device. This distinction means that it
may take multiple calls to Start() to produce all the child handles. If R emainingDevicePath is NULL , all
remaining child handles are created at once.
When a bus driver opens an I/O-related protocol on the controller handle, it typically uses an open mode
of EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL
BY
_
_
_
_
DRIVER . However, depending on the type of bus driver, a return code of
EFI
ALREADY
_
_
STARTED from OpenProtocol() may be acceptable. If a device driver gets this return code, then the
device driver should not manage the controller handle. If a bus driver gets this return code, then it
means that the bus driver has already connected to the controller handle.
The figure below shows a simple bus driver that consumes Protocol A from a bus controller handle and
creates N child handles with a Device Path Protocol and Protocol B . The Stop() function is responsible for
destroying the child handles by removing Protocol B and the Device Path Protocol . Protocol A is first
opened EFI

6.2.6 Bus drivers that produce one child in Start()
6.2.6 Bus drivers that produce one child in Start()
If the R emainingDevicePath parameter passed into Supported() and Start() is NULL , the bus driver must
produce child handles for all children. If R emainingDevicePath is not NULL , the bus driver should parse
R emainingDevicePath and attempt to produce only the one child device described by
R emainingDevicePath. If the driver does not recogniz e the device path node in R emainingDevicePath, or
if the device described by the device path node does not match any of the children currently attached
to the bus controller, the Supported() and Start() services should fail. If the R emainingDevicePath is
recogniz ed, and the device path node does match a child device that is attached to the bus controller,
a child handle should be created for that one child device.
Note: This step does not make sense for all bus types because some require the entire bus to be
enumerated to produce even a single child. In these cases, the R emainingDevicePath should be
ignored.
If a bus type has the ability to produce a child handle without enumerating the entire bus, this ability
should be implemented. Implementing this feature provides faster boot times and is one of the major
advantages of the UEFI driver model.
The UEFI boot manager may pass the R emainingDevicePath of the console device and boot devices to
ConnectController() , and ConnectController() then pass this same R emainingDevicePath into the Supported()
and Start() services of the Driver Binding Protocol. This design allows the minimum number of drivers to
be started to boot an operating system. The process can be repeated, so one additional child handle
can be produced in each call to Start() .
Also, a few child handles can be created from the first few calls to Start() and then a
R emainingDevicePath of NULL may be passed in, which would require the rest of the child handle to be
produced. For example, most SCSI buses do not need to be scanned to create a handle for a SCSI
device when SCSI PUN and SCSI L UN are known ahead of time. By starting only the single mass storage
boot device, on the OS required SCSI boot channel, scanning of all the other SCSI devices can be
eliminated.

6.2.8 Bus drivers that produce at most one child in Start()
Some bus drivers are for bus controllers that have only a single port, so they have at most one child
handle. If R emainingDevicePath is NULL , then that one child handle should be produced. If
R emainingDevicePath is not NULL , then the R emainingDevicePath should be parsed to see if it matches
a device path node that the bus driver knows how to produce.
For example, a serial port can have only one device attached to it. This device may be a terminal, a
mouse, or a drill press, for example. The driver that consumes the Serial I/O Protocol from a handle must
create a child handle with the produced protocol that uses the services of the Serial I/O Protocol.

6.2.9 Bus drivers that produce no children in Start()
If a bus controller supports hot-plug devices and the UEFI driver wants to support hotplug events, then
no child handles should be produced in Start() . Instead, a periodic timer event should be created, and
each time the notification function for the periodic timer event is called, the bus driver should check to
see if any devices have been hot added or hot removed from the bus. Any devices that were already
plugged into the bus when the driver was first started look like they were just hot added. This means
that for the devices that were already plugged into the bus, the child handles are produced the first
time the notification function is executed.
The USB bus driver is an example driver in the EDK II that produces no children in the Start() service of
the Driver Binding Protocol. This driver is located at MdeModulePkg\Bus\Usb\UsbBusDxe directory .

Sometimes a bus driver may produce a child handle, and that child handle actually uses the services of
multiple parent controllers. This design is useful for multiplexing a group of parent controllers.
The bus driver, in this case, manages multiple parent controllers and produces a single child handle.
The services produced on that single child handle make use of the services from each of the parent
controllers. T ypically, the child device is a virtual device, so a Device Path Protocol would not be installed
onto the child handle.

7 Driver Entry Point
7 Driver Entry Point
This chapter covers the entry point for the different categories of UEFI drivers and their optional
features impacting the implementation of the driver entry point. The most common category of UEFI
driver is one that follows the UEFI driver model. This category of driver is discussed first, followed by the
other major types of drivers and the optional features those drivers may choose to implement. The
following categories of UEFI drivers are discussed:
UEFI Driver that follows the UEFI Driver Model
UEFI R untime Driver
Initializ ing driver
R oot bridge driver
Service driver
The driver entry point is the function called when a UEFI driver is started with the StartImage() service. At
this point the driver has already been loaded into memory with the LoadImage() service.
UEFI drivers use the PE/COFF image format that is defined in the Microsoft Portable Executable and
Common Object File Format Specification. This format supports a single entry point in the code section
of the image. The StartImage() service transfers control to the UEFI driver at this entry point.
The example below shows the entry point to a UEFI driver called AbcDriverEntryPoint() . This example is
expanded upon as each of UEFI driver categories and features are discussed. The entry point to a UEFI
driver is identical to the standard UEFI image entry point that is discussed in the UEFI Image Entry Point
section of the UEFI Specification. The image handle of the UEFI driver and a pointer to the UEFI system
table are passed into every UEFI driver. The image handle allows the UEFI driver to discover information
about itself, and the pointer to the UEFI system table allows the UEFI driver to make UEFI Boot Service
and UEFI R untime Service calls.
The UEFI driver can use the UEFI boot services to access the protocol interfaces that are installed in
the handle database, which allows the UEFI driver to use the services that are provided through the
various protocol interfaces.

# include <Uefi.h>
/**

7.1 Optional Features
7.1 Optional Features
This section summariz es optional features impacting the implementation of the driver entry point of a
UEFI Driver. This is not a complete summary of all the optional UEFI driver features.
T able 21 below provides the list of optional features and set of UEFI driver categories.
If an entry in the table is empty, the feature does not ever apply to that category of UEFI Driver and
must never be implemented. If the entry in the table contains a value such as 1.1 or 2.0, it means the
feature optionally applies to that category of UEFI Driver if, and only if, the UEFI Driver is required to run
correctly on platform firmware that conforms to that specific version of the EFI Specification or UEFI
Specification.
For example, 2.0 refers to the UEFI 2.0 Specification, and 1.02 refers to the EFI 1.02 Specification. If the
entry in the table contains a value followed by a '+' such as 1.1+ or 2.1+, then that means the feature
optionally applies to that category of UEFI Driver if the UEFI Driver is required to run correctly on
platform firmware that conforms to the version of the EFI Specification or UEFI Specification specified by
the value or higher values. For example, 2.0+ refers to the UEFI 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.3.1
Specifications.
This table can be used to select features that apply to a specific UEFI Driver implementation once the
UEFI Driver writer knows what types of UEFI platforms with which the UEFI Driver must be compatible as
well as the set of optional features the UEFI Driver must support.
For example, if a UEFI Driver is required to run on platforms that support UEFI 2.1 or higher, the
Component Name Protocol, Driver Configuration Protocol, Driver Configuration 2 Protocol, and Driver
Diagnostics Protocol need not be implemented because they apply only to UEFI platforms prior to UEFI
2.1.
The Driver Health Protocol may be optionally implemented, but the Driver Health Protocol is expected to
be used only by a platform that is UEFI 2.2 or higher. In this case, the UEFI Driver must not depend on
the Driver Health Protocol being called to function correctly because it is not called by a UEFI 2.1
platform.

7.2 UEFI Driver Model
7.2 UEFI Driver Model
Drivers that follow the UEFI driver model are not allowed to touch any hardware in their driver entry
point. In fact, these types of drivers do very little in their driver entry point.
They are required to register protocol interfaces in the Handle Database and may also choose to
register HII packages in the HII Database, register an Unload() service in the UEFI Driver's Loaded Image
Protocol, and create events that are signaled when an operating system calls ExitBootServices() or
SetVirtualAddressMap() . This design allows these types of drivers to be loaded at any point in the system
initializ ation sequence because their driver entry points depend only on a few of the UEFI boot services.
The items registered in the driver entry point are used later in the boot sequence to initializ e, configure,
or diagnose devices required to boot an operating system.
All UEFI drivers following the UEFI driver model must install one or more instances of the Driver Binding
Protocol onto handles in the handle database. The first Driver Binding Protocol is typically installed onto
the ImageHandle passed into the UEFI Driver entry point. Additional instances of the Driver Binding
Protocol must be installed onto new handles in the Handle Database.
The EDK II library UefiLib provides four functions that simplify the implementation of the driver entry
point of a UEFI driver. The examples in this section make use of these driver initializ ation functions as
shown in the following example.

EfiLibInstallDriverBinding() installs the Driver Binding Protocol onto the handle specified by
DriverBindingHandle. DriverBindingHandle is typically the same as ImageHandle, but if it is NULL , the
Driver Binding Protocol is installed onto a newly created handle. This function is typically used by a UEFI
Driver that does not implement any of the optional driver features.
EfiLibInstallAllDriverProtocols() installs the Driver Binding Protocol, and the driverrelated protocols from the
older UEFI Specification (and EFI Specification), onto the handle specified by DriverBindingHandle. The
optional driver-related protocols are defined as OPTIONAL because they can be NULL if a driver is not
producing that specific optional protocol. Once again, the DriverBindingHandle is typically the same as
ImageHandle, but if it is NULL , all driver-related protocols are installed onto a newly created handle. This
function is typically used by a UEFI Driver required to be compatible with the EFI 1.10 Specification.
EfiLibInstallDriverBindingComponentName2() installs the Driver Binding Protocol and the Component Name
Protocols onto the handle specified by DriverBindingHandle. The optional driver-related protocols are
defined as OPTIONAL because they can be NULL if a driver is not producing that specific optional protocol.
Once again, the DriverBindingHandle is typically the same as ImageHandle, but if it is NULL , all
driverrelated protocols are installed onto a newly created handle. This function is typically used by a
UEFI Driver that implements the Component Name Protocols that are strongly recommended .
EfiLibInstallAllDriverProtocols2() installs the Driver Binding Protocol, Component Name Protocols, Driver

7.2.1 Single Driver Binding Protocol
7.2.1 Single Driver Binding Protocol
The following is an example of the entry point to the Abc driver that installs the Driver Binding Protocol
gAbcDriverBinding , the Component Name 2 Protocol gAbcComponentName2 , and the Component Name Protocol
gAbcComponentName onto the Abc driver's image handle and does not install any of the other optional driver-
related protocols or features. This driver returns the status from the UEFI driver library function
EfiLibInstallDriverBindingComponentName2() . See Chapter 9 for details on the services and data fields produced
by the Driver Binding Protocol and Chapter 11 for details on the Component Name 2 Protocol and the
Component Name Protocol.
Notice that the Component Name Protocol and the Component Name 2 Protocol use the same function
pointers for their services called AbcGetDriverName() and AbcGetControllerName() . This is a siz e reduction
technique supported by the EDK II that reduces the overhead for a single UEFI Driver to support both
Component Name Protocols.
Also note that the optional protocol structures are declared with GLOBAL
REMOVE
IF
_
_
_
UNREFERENCED . This style
allows these structures and the associated services to be removed if the Component Name feature is
disabled when this UEFI driver is compiled. The EDK II library UefiLib uses several Platform Configuration
Database (PCD) feature flags to enable and disable the Component Name Protocols and Driver
Diagnostics Protocols at build time. This allows a developer to implement all of these in the UEFI Driver
sources and select the ones that are actually needed for a specific release at build time. Chapter 30
covers how to build UEFI Drivers in the EDK II and also covers configuration of UEFI Drivers through PCD
settings.
Note: This example and many other examples throughout this guide make use of the EDK II library
DebugLib that provides DEBUG() and ASSERT() related macros. These macros are very useful during
development and debug. However, ASSERT() related macros must be disabled when UEFI Drivers are
released. Chapter 31 covers the PCD setting to enable and disable the macros provided by DebugLib .

7.2.2 Multiple Driver Binding Protocols
7.2.2 Multiple Driver Binding Protocols
If a UEFI driver supports more than one parent I/O abstraction, the driver should produce a Driver
Binding Protocol for each of the parent I/O abstractions. For example, a UEFI driver could be written to
support more than one type of hardware device (for example, USB and PCI). If code can be shared for
the common features of a hardware device, then such a driver might save space and reduce
maintenance. Example drivers in the EDK II that produce more than one Driver Binding Protocol are the
console platform driver and the console splitter driver. These drivers contain multiple Driver Binding
Protocols because they depend on multiple console-related parent I/O abstractions.
The first Driver Binding Protocol is typically installed onto the ImageHandle of the UEFI driver and
additional Driver Binding Protocols are installed onto new handles. The UEFI driver library functions used
in the previous two examples support the creation of new handles by passing in a NULL for the fourth
argument. The example below shows the driver entry point for a driver that produces two instances of
the Driver Binding Protocol with no optional driver-related protocols. When multiple Driver Binding
Protocols are produced by a single driver, the optional driver-related protocols are installed onto the
same handles as those of the Driver Binding Protocols.

7.2.3 Adding Driver Health Protocol Feature
7.2.3 Adding Driver Health Protocol Feature
The Driver Health Protocol provides services allowing a UEFI Driver to express the health status of a
controller, return status messages associated with the health status, perform repair operations and
request configuration changes required to place the controller in a usable state. This protocol is
required only for devices that may be in a bad state which can be recovered through a repair operation
or a configuration change. If a device can never be in a bad state, or a device can be in a bad state for
which there is no recovery possible, this protocol should not be installed.
There are no EDK II library functions to help install the Driver Health Protocol. Instead, the UEFI Driver
that requires this feature must install the Driver Health Protocol using the UEFI Boot Service
InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() . Example 92, below, expands Example 91, above, and adds a Driver
Health Protocol instance to ImageHandle, the same handle on which the Driver Binding Protocol is
installed.

_
_
PROTOCOL is optional. It is typically produced by UEFI Drivers associated with a
set of similar controllers where multiple versions of a UEFI Driver for the set of similar controllers may be
simultaneously present in a platform. This protocol allows each UEFI Driver to advertise a version
number such that the UEFI Driver with the highest version is selected to manage all the controllers in
the set of similar controllers.
PCI Use Case : If a platform has 3 PCI SCSI adapters from the same manufacturer, and the manufacturer
requires the PCI SCSI adapter having the highest version UEFI Driver to manage all 3 PCI SCSI adapters,
the Driver Family Override Protocol is required and provides the version value used to make the
selection. If the Driver Family Override Protocol is not produced, the Bus Specific Driver Override Protocol
for PCI selects the UEFI Driver from the adapter's PCI Option ROM to manage each adapter.
There are no EDK II library functions to help install the Driver Family Override Protocol. Instead, the UEFI
Driver requiring this feature must install the Driver Family Override Protocol using the UEFI Boot Service

7.3 Adding the Driver Supported EFI V ersion Protocol Feature
This feature provides information on the version of the UEFI Specification to which the UEFI Driver
conforms. The version information follows the same format as the version field in the EFI System T able.
This feature is required for UEFI Drivers on PCI and other plug in cards.
There are no EDK II library functions to help install the Driver Supported EFI V ersion Protocol. Instead,
the UEFI Driver requiring this feature must install the Driver Supported EFI V ersion Protocol using the
UEFI Boot Service InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() . A UEFI Driver must install, at most, one instance of this
protocol and, if it is produced, it must be installed onto the ImageHandle. This protocol is composed of
only data fields, so no functions need be implemented to complete its implementation. Example 94,
below, expands Example 93, above, and adds a Driver Supported EFI V ersion Protocol instance to
ImageHandle. The Driver Supported EFI V ersion Protocol instance in this example specifies that this UEFI
Driver follows the UEFI 2.3.1 Specification.

7.4 Adding HII Packages Feature
7.4 Adding HII Packages Feature
HII packages provide strings, fonts, and forms that allow users (such as IT administrators) to change
the configuration of UEFI managed devices. These HII packages are required only if a driver must
provide the ability for a user to change configuration settings for a device. A UEFI Driver registers HII
packages in the HII Database.
The Image Services and the Human Interface Infrastructure Overview sections of the UEFI Specification
define a method for HII packages associated with a UEFI Driver to be automatically installed as a
protocol on ImageHandle when the UEFI Driver is loaded using the UEFI Boot Service LoadImage() . The HII
packages are stored in a resource section of the PE/COFF image. The driver entry point of a UEFI Driver
is responsible for looking up the HII Package List on ImageHandle and registering that list of HII
packages into the HII Database. The example below shows an example of a driver entry point that
performs such a registration process.

7.6 Adding the Unload Feature
7.6 Adding the Unload Feature
Any UEFI driver can be made unloadable. This feature is useful for some driver categories, but it may not
be useful at all for other driver categories. It does not make sense to add the unload feature to an
initializ ing driver because this category of driver already returns an error from the driver entry point,
which forces the UEFI Image Services to automatically unload the initializ ing driver.
Similarly, it usually doesn't make sense for root bridge drivers or service drivers to add the unload
feature. These categories of driver typically produce protocols consumed by other UEFI drivers to
produce basic console functions and boot device abstractions. If a root bridge driver or a service driver
is unloaded, any UEFI driver using the protocols from those drivers would start to fail. If a root bridge
driver or service driver guarantees that it is not being used by any other UEFI components, they may be
unloaded without any adverse side effects.
Still, the Unload() function can be very helpful. It allows the "unload" command in the UEFI Shell to
completely remove a UEFI driver image from memory and remove all of the driver's handles and
protocols from the handle database. If a driver is suspected of causing a bug, it is often helpful to
"unload" the driver from the UEFI Shell and then run tests knowing that the driver is no longer present
in the platform. In these cases, the Unload() feature is superior to simply stopping the driver with the
disconnect UEFI Shell command. If a driver is just disconnected, the UEFI Shell commands "connect" and
"reconnect" may inadvertently restart the driver.
The unload feature is also very helpful when testing and developing new versions of the driver. The old
version can be completely unloaded (removed from the system) and new versions of the driver, even
those having the same version number, can safely be installed in the system without concern the older
version of the driver may be invoked during the next connect or reconnect operation.
Be mindful that, because Unload() completely removes the driver from system memory, it might not be
possible to load it back into the system in the same session. For example, if the driver is stored in
system firmware or in a PCI option ROM, no method may be available for reloading the driver without
completely rebooting the system.
The Unload() service is one of the fields in the EFI
LOADED
IMAGE
_
_
_
PROTOCOL . This protocol is automatically
created and installed when a UEFI image is loaded with the EFI Boot Service LoadImage() . When the
EFI
LOADED
IMAGE
_
_
_
PROTOCOL is created by LoadImage() , the Unload() service is initializ ed to NULL . It is the driver
entry point's responsibility to register the Unload() function in the EFI
LOADED
IMAGE
PROTOCOL .
_
_
_
It is recommended that UEFI drivers following the UEFI driver model add the unload feature. It is very useful
during driver development, driver debug, and system integration. It is strongly recommended that this
service remain in drivers for add-in adapters to help debug interaction issues during system integration.
Example 98, below, shows the same driver entry point from Example 89 (earlier in this section) with the
unload feature added. Example 98 shows only a template for the Unload() function because the
implementation of this service varies from driver to driver. The Unload() service is responsible for
cleaning up everything the driver has done since initializ ation. This responsibility means that the
Unload() service should do the following:
Free any resources that were allocated.
R emove any protocols that were added.
Destroy any handles that were created.
If the Unload() service does not want to unload the driver at the time the Unload() service is called, it
may return an error and not unload the driver. The only way a driver can actually be unloaded is by
ensuring that the Unload() service has been registered in the EFI
LOADED
IMAGE
PROTOCOL and that it returns
_
_
_
EFI
SUCCESS .

7.6 Adding the Unload Feature
The EDK II provides an easy method to declare the name of the UEFI driver-specific Unload() function in
the [Defines] section of the INF file for the UEFI Driver. Example 99, below, shows the INF file that defines
UNLOAD
_
IMAGE to the AbcUnload() function shown in the previous example. The specified Unload() function
automatically registers in the EFI
LOADED
IMAGE
_
_
_
PROTOCOL before the entry point of the UEFI Driver is called.
See Section 30.3 for more details on UEFI Driver INF files and Appendix A for a complete template of the
INF file for a UEFI Driver.

Example 100, below, shows one possible implementation of the Unload() function for a UEFI driver
following the UEFI driver model. It finds all the devices it manages and disconnects the driver from those
devices. Next, the protocol interfaces installed in the driver entry point must be removed. The example
shown here matches the driver entry point from Example 98, above. There are many possible algorithms
that can be implemented in the Unload() service. A driver may choose to be unloadable if, and only if, it
is not managing any devices at all. A driver may also choose to keep track of the devices it is managing
internally so it can selectively disconnect itself from those devices when it is unloaded.

7.7 Adding the Exit Boot Services feature
7.7 Adding the Exit Boot Services feature
Some UEFI drivers may need to put their devices into a quiescent state or a known state prior to
booting an operating system. This case is considered to be very rare because the OS-present drivers
should not depend on a UEFI driver running at all. Not depending on a running UEFI driver means that
an OS-present driver should be able to handle the following:
A device in its power-on reset state
A device that was recently hot added while the OS is running
A device that was managed by a UEFI driver up to the point the OS was booted
A device that was managed for a short period of time by a UEFI driver
In the rare case when a UEFI driver is required to place a device in a quiescent or known state before
booting an operating system, the driver can use a special event type called an Exit Boot Services event.
This event is signaled when an OS loader or OS kernel calls the UEFI boot service ExitBootServices() . This
call is the point in time where the system firmware still owns the platform, but the system firmware is
just about to transfer system ownership to the operating system. In this transition time, no
modifications to the UEFI memory map are allowed (see the Image Services section of the UEFI
Specification). This requirement means that the notification function for an Exit Boot Services event is
not allowed to directly or indirectly allocate or free and memory through the UEFI memory services.
Examples from the EDK II that use this feature are the PCI device drivers for USB Host Controllers. Some
USB Host Controllers are PCI Bus Masters that continuously access a memory buffer to poll for operation
requests. Access to this memory buffer by a USB Host Controller may be required to boot an operation
system, but this activity must be terminated when the OS calls ExitBootServices() . The typical action in the
Exit Boot Services Event for these types of drivers is to disable the PCI bus master and place the USB
Host Controller into a halted state
Example 101, below, shows the same example as in Example 100, above, but an Exit Boot Services
event is also created. The template for the notification function for the Exit Boot Services event is also
shown. This notification function typically contains code to find the list of device handles that the driver
is currently managing, and it then performs operations on those handles to make sure they are in the
proper OS handoff state. R emember that no memory allocation or free operations can be performed
from this notification function.

If a UEFI driver supports both the unload feature and the Exit Boot Services feature, the Unload()
function must close the Exit Boot Services event by calling CloseEvent() . This event is typically declared as
a global variable so it can be easily accessed from the Unload() function. The following example is the
same as the previous example, except the entry point looks up the EFI
LOADED
IMAGE
PROTOCOL associated

The example below shows an initializ ing driver called Abc . This driver initializ es one or more components
in the platform and exits. It does not produce any services that are required after the entry point has
been executed. This type of driver returns an error from the entry point so the driver is unloaded by the
UEFI image services. An initializ ing driver never registers an Unload() service because an initializ ing driver
is always unloaded after the driver entry point is executed. This type is typically used by OEMs and IBVs
to initializ e the state of a hardware component in the platform such as a processor or chipset
component.

7.9 Service Driver entry point
A service driver produces one or more protocol interfaces on the driver's image handle or on newly
created handles. The example below, shows the Decompress Protocol being installed onto the driver's
image handle. A service driver may produce an Unload() service, and that service would be required to
uninstall the protocols that were installed in the driver's entry point.
Caution: The Unload() service for a service driver may be a dangerous operation because there is no
way for the service driver to know if the protocols that it installed are being used by other UEFI
components. If the service driver is unloaded and other UEFI components are still using the protocols
that were produced by the unloaded driver, then the system is likely to fail.

7.10 R oot bridge driver entry point
7.10 Root bridge driver entry point
R oot bridge drivers produce handles and software abstractions for the bus types directly produced by a
core chipset. The PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol is an example of a software abstraction for root bridges
that is defined in the PCI Bus Support chapter of the UEFI Specification.
UEFI drivers that produce root bridge abstractions do not follow the UEFI driver model. Instead, they
initializ e hardware and directly produce the handles and protocols in the driver entry point. R oot bridge
drivers are slightly different from service drivers in the following ways:
R oot bridge drivers always creates new handles.
It installs a software abstraction for each root bridge, such as the PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol
It installs a Device Path Protocol for each root bridge that describes the programmatic path to the
root bridge device.
A root bridge driver may register an Unload() service, and that service would be required to uninstall the
protocols that were installed in the driver's entry point.
Caution: The Unload() service for a root bridge driver may be a dangerous operation because there is
no way for the root bridge driver to know if the protocols it installed are being used by other UEFI
components. If the root bridge driver is unloaded and other UEFI components are still using the
protocols that were produced by the unloaded driver, then the system is likely to fail.
The example, below shows an example of a root bridge driver that produces one handle for a system
with a single PCI root bridge. A Device Path Protocol with an ACPI device path node and the PCI R oot
Bridge I/O Protocol are installed onto a newly created handle. The ACPI device path node for the PCI root
bridge must match the description of the PCI root bridge in the ACPI table for the platform.
In this example, the Device Path Protocol and PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol are declared as global
variables. Additional private data may need to be required to properly manage a PCI root bridge.

7.10 R oot bridge driver entry point
The example below, shows an example for a root bridge driver that produces four handles for a system
with four PCI root bridges. A Device Path Protocol with an ACPI device path node and the PCI R oot Bridge
I/O Protocol are installed onto each of the newly created handles. The ACPI device path nodes for each
of the PCI root bridges must match the description of the PCI root bridges in the ACPI tables for the
platform.
In this example, the
_
UID field for the root bridges has the values of 0, 1, 2, and 3 However, there is no
requirement that the
_
UID field starts at 0 or that they are contiguous. The only requirement is that the
_
UID field for each root bridge matches the
_
UID field in the ACPI table describing the same root bridge
controller.
T emplates for the Device Path Protocol and PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol are declared as global variables,
and copies of those global variable template are made for each PCI root bridge using the
AllocateCopyPool() function in the EDK II library MemoryAllocationLib . Additional private data may need to be
required to properly manage a group of PCI root bridges.

7.11 R untime Drivers
7.11 Runtime Drivers
UEFI R untime Drivers are not common. If a UEFI Driver does not need to provide services after
ExitBootServices() , the UEFI Driver should not use the techniques described in this section. The best
example of a runtime driver following the UEFI driver model is an UNDI driver providing services for a
network interface controller (NIC).
A UEFI R untime Driver provides services that are available after ExitBootServices() has been called. UEFI
Drivers of this category are much more difficult to implement and validate because they are required to
execute in both the pre-boot environment, where the system firmware owns the platform, and in the
post-boot environment, where an operating system owns the platform.
An OS may choose to execute in a virtual addressing mode and, as a result, may prefer to call firmware
services provided by UEFI R untime Drivers in a virtual addressing mode. A UEFI R untime Driver must not
make any assumptions about the type of operating system to be booted, so the driver must always be
able to switch from using physical addresses to using virtual addresses if the operating system calls
SetVirtualAddressMap() .
In addition, because all memory regions marked as boot services memory in the UEFI memory map are
converted to available memory when the OS boots, a UEFI R untime Driver must allocate memory buffers
required by the services provided after ExitBootServices() in order to be allocated from runtime memory .
A UEFI R untime Driver typically creates the following two events so the driver is notified when these
important transitions occur:
Exit Boot Services event
Set Virtual Address Map event
The Exit Boot Services event is signaled when the OS loader or OS kernel calls ExitBootServices() . After
this point, the UEFI driver is not allowed to use any of the UEFI boot services. The UEFI runtime services
and services from other runtime drivers are still available.
The Set Virtual Address Map event is signaled when the OS loader or OS kernel calls SetVirtualAddressMap() .
If this event is signaled, the OS loader or OS kernel requests that all runtime components be converted
from their physical address mapping to the virtual address mappings that are then passed to
SetVirtualAddressMap() .
The UEFI firmware below the UEFI Driver performs most of the work here by relocating all the UEFI
images from their physically addressed code and data segments to their virtually addressed code and
data segments. However, the UEFI firmware below the UEFI Driver is not aware of runtime memory
buffers have been allocated by a UEFI R untime Driver. UEFI firmware below the UEFI Driver is also not
aware if there are any pointer values within those allocated buffers that must be converted from
physical addresses to virtual addresses.
Caution: The notification function for the Set Virtual Address Map event is required to use the
UEFI R untime Service ConvertPointer() to convert all pointers in global variables and allocated runtime
buffers from physical address to virtual addresses. This code may be complex and difficult to get correct
because, at this time, no tools are available to help know when all the pointers have been converted.
When not done correctly, the only symptom noticed may be that the OS crashes or hangs due to a
condition in the middle of a call to a service produced by a runtime driver.

7.11 R untime Drivers
Note: The algorithm to convert pointers can be especially complex if the UEFI
_
R untime Driver manages linked lists or nested structures. The SetVirtualAddressMap() event executes in
physical mode, so all linked list and structure traversals must be performed with the physical versions of
the pointer values. Once a pointer value is converted from a physical address to a virtual address, that
pointer value cannot be used again within the SetVirtualAddressMap() event. The typical approach is to
convert the pointers to the leaf structures first and work towards the root.
The following example shows the driver entry point for a UEFI R untime Driver that creates an Exit Boot
Services event and a Set Virtual Address Map event. These events are typically declared as global
variables. The notification function for the Exit Boot Services event sets a global variable gAtRuntime to
TRUE , allowing the code in other functions to know if the UEFI boot services are available or not. This
global variable is initializ ed to FALSE in its declaration. The notification function for the Set Virtual
Address Map event converts one global pointer from a physical address to a virtual address as an
example using a the EfiConvertPointer() function from the EDK II library UefiRuntimeLib . A real driver might
have many more pointers to convert. In general, a UEFI R untime Driver should be designed to reduce or
eliminate pointers that need to be converted to minimiz e the likelihood of missing a pointer conversion.

8 Private Context Data Structures
8 Private Context Data Structures
UEFI drivers managing more than one controller need to be designed with reentrancy in mind. This
means that global variables should not be used to track information about individual controllers.
Instead, data structures should be allocated with the UEFI memory services for each controller, and
those data structures should contain all the information that the driver requires to manage each
individual controller.
This chapter introduces some object-oriented programming techniques that can be applied to drivers
managing controllers. These techniques can simplify driver design and implementation. The concept of
a private context data structure containing all the information required to manage a controller is
introduced. This data structure contains the public data fields, public services, private data fields, and
private services a UEFI driver may require to manage a controller.
Some categories of UEFI drivers do not require the use of these data structures. If a UEFI driver only
produces a single protocol, or it manages, at most, one device, the techniques presented here are not
required. An initializ ing driver does not produce any services and does not manage any devices, so it
does not use this technique. A service driver that produces a single protocol and does not manage any
devices does not likely use this technique. A root bridge driver that manages a single root bridge device
does not likely use this technique, but a root bridge driver that manages more than one root bridge
device may use this technique.
Finally, all UEFI drivers that follow the UEFI driver model should use this technique. Even if the driver
writer is convinced that the UEFI driver manages only a single device in a platform, this technique
should still be used because it simplifies the process of updating the driver to manage more than one
device. The driver writer should make as few device and platform assumptions as possible when
designing a new driver.
Implementations of Hybrid drivers that follow the UEFI Driver Model may define two different private
context data structures―one for the bus controller and another one for the child controllers it
produces.
It is possible to use other techniques to track the information required to manage multiple controllers in
a re-entrant-safe manner, but those techniques likely require more overhead in the driver itself to
manage this information. The techniques presented here are intended to produce small driver
executables. These techniques are used throughout the drivers in EDK II.

8.1 Containing R ecord Macro
8.1 Containing Record Macro
The containing record macro, called CR() , enables good object-oriented programming practices. It
returns a pointer to the structure using a pointer to one of the structure's fields. Protocol producing
UEFI drivers use this macro to retrieve the private context data structure from a pointer to a produced
protocol interface. Protocol functions are required to pass in a pointer to the protocol instance as the
first argument to the function. C++ does this automatically, and the pointer to the object instance is
called a this pointer. Since UEFI drivers are written in C, a close equivalent is implemented by requiring
that the first argument of every protocol function be the pointer to the protocol's instance structure
called "This.
" Each protocol function then uses the CR() macro to retrieve a pointer to the private
context data structure from this first argument called This.
The example below is the definition of the CR() macro from the EDK II library DebugLib . The CR() macro is
provided a pointer to the following:
A field in a data structure
The name of the field
It uses this information to compute the offset of the field in the data structure and subtracts this offset
from the pointer to the field. This calculation results in a pointer to the data structure that contains the
specified field. BASE
_
CR() returns a pointer to the data structure that contains the specified field. For
debug builds, CR() also does an additional check to verify a signature value. If the signature value does
not match, an ASSERT() message is generated and the system is halted or generates a breakpoint. For
production builds, the signature checks are typically disabled. Most UEFI drivers define additional
macros based on the CR() macro that retrieves the private context data structure based on a This
pointer to a produced protocol. These additional macros are typically given names that make it easier
to understand in the source code that the This pointer is being used to retrieve the private context
data structure defined by the UEFI Driver.
Example 111-Containing record macro definitions
/**
Macro that calls DebugAssert() if the containing record does not have a matching signature. If the signatures matches, then
a pointer to the data structure that contains a specified field of that data structure is returned. This is a lightweight meth
od that hides information by placing a public data structure inside a larger private data structure and using a pointer to the
public data structure to retrieve a pointer to the private data structure.
If the data type specified by TYPE does not contain the field specified by Field, then the module will not compile.
If TYPE does not contain a field called Signature, then the module will not compile.
@param Record The pointer to the field specified by Field within a data structure of type TYPE.
@param TYPE The name of the data structure type to return
This data structure must contain the field specified by Field.
@param Field The name of the field in the data structure specified by TYPE to which Record points.

8.2 Data structure design
8.2 Data structure design
Proper data structure design is one of the keys to making UEFI Drivers both simple and easy to
maintain. If a UEFI Driver writer fails to include fields in a private context data structure, then it may
require a complex algorithm to retrieve the required data through the various UEFI services. By
designing-in the proper fields, these complex algorithms are avoided, resulting in a driver with a smaller
executable footprint. Static data, commonly accessed data, and services related to the management of
a device should all be placed in a private context data structure.
Another key requirement is that the private context data structure must be easy to find when an I/O
service produced by the driver is called. The I/O services produced by a driver are exported through
protocol interfaces, and all protocol interfaces include a This parameter as the first argument. The This
parameter is a pointer to the protocol interface containing the I/O service being called. The data
structure design presented here shows how the This pointer passed into an I/O service can be used to
easily gain access to the private context data structure.
A private context data structure is typically composed of the following types of fields:
A signature for the data structure
The handle of the controller or the child that is being managed or produced
The group of protocol interfaces that are being consumed
The group of protocol interfaces that are being produced
Private data fields and services that are used to manage a specific controller
The signature is useful when debugging UEFI drivers. Signatures are composed of four ASCII characters
in a data field of type UINTN and must be the first field of the structure with the field name of Signature.
When memory dumps are performed, signatures stand out by making the beginning of specific data
structures easy to identify . Memory dump tools with search capabilities can also be used to find specific
private context data structures in memory . In addition, debug builds of UEFI drivers can perform
signature checks whenever these private context data structures are accessed. If the signature does
not match, then an ASSERT() may be generated. If one of these ASSERT() messages is observed, a UEFI
driver was likely passed in a bad or corrupt This pointer or the contents of the data structure that This
refers too has been corrupted.
Device drivers typically store the handle of the device they are managing in a private context data
structure. This mechanism provides quick access to the device handle if needed during I/O operations
or driver-related operations. R oot bridge drivers and bus drivers typically store the handle of the child
that was created, and a hybrid driver typically stores both the handle of the bus controller and the
handle of the child controller produced.
The group of consumed protocol interfaces is the set of pointers to the protocol interfaces that are
opened in the Start() function of the driver's EFI
DRIVER
BINDING
_
_
_
PROTOCOL . As each protocol interface is
opened using the UEFI Boot Service OpenProtocol() , a pointer to the consumed protocol interface is
stored in the private context data structure. These same protocols must be closed in the Stop()
function of the driver's EFI
DRIVER
BINDING
_
_
_
PROTOCOL with calls to the UEFI Boot Service CloseProtocol() .
Basically, the stop section should mirror the start section of the driver, closing all protocols that were
started.
The group of produced protocol interfaces declares the storage for the protocols that the driver
produces. These protocols typically provide software abstractions for consoles or boot devices.
The number and type of private data fields vary from driver to driver. These fields contain the context
information for a device that is not contained in the consumed or produced protocols. For example, a
driver for a mass storage device may store information about the characteristics of the mass storage

device such as the number of cylinders, number of heads, and number of sectors on the physical mass
storage device managed by the driver.
Appendix A contains the generic template for the <<DriverName>> .h file with the declaration of a private
context data structure that can be used for root bridge drivers, device drivers, bus drivers, or hybrid
drivers. The #define statement above the private context data structure declaration using the
SIGNA TURE
_
32() macro is used to initializ e the Signature field when the private context data structure is
allocated. This same #define statement is used to verify the Signature field whenever a driver accesses
the private context data structure.
A set of macros below the private context data structure declaration help retrieve a pointer to the
private context data structure from a This pointer for each of the produced protocols using the CR()
macro introduced above. These macros are the simple mechanisms that allow private data fields to be
accessed from the services in each of the produced protocols.
The example below shows an example of the private context data structure from the DiskIoDxe driver in
the MdeModulePkg . It contains the #define statement for the data structure's signature. In this case, the
signature is the ASCII string " dskI "
. The example also contains a pointer to the only protocol that this
driver consumes; the Block I/O Protocol. It contains storage for the only protocol this driver produces;
the Disk I/O Protocol. It does not have any additional private data fields. The macro at the bottom
retrieves the private context data structure from a pointer to the field called DiskIo that is a pointer to
the one protocol that this driver produces.

8.3 Allocating private context data structures
8.3 Allocating private context data structures
Private context data structures are allocated in the Start() function of the Driver Binding Protocol. The
service that is typically used to allocate the private context data structures is the UEFI Boot Service
AllocatePool() . The following example shows the generic template for allocating and z eroing a private
context data structure in the Start() function of the Driver Binding Protocol. In this example, the UEFI
Boot Service SetMem() is used to fill the allocated buffer with z eros. This code example shows only a
fragment from the Start() function. Chapter 9 of this guide covers the services that are produced by
the Driver Binding Protocol in more detail. The code examples that follow show how the implementation
of Start() can be simplified by using the EDK II library MemoryAllocationLib .

8.5 R etrieving private context data structures
8.5 Retrieving private context data structures
The protocol functions produced by a UEFI driver need to access the private context data structure.
These functions typically use the set of consumed protocols and the private data fields to perform the
protocol function's required operation.
Appendix A contains a template for a <<ProtocolName>> .c file for the implementation of a protocol
function that retrieves the private context data structure using the CR() based macro and
the This pointer for the produced protocol.
The following example shows a code fragment from the ReadDisk() service of the EFI
DISK

_
_
_
PROTOCOL that
is produced by the DiskIoDxe driver in the MdeModulePkg . It uses the CR() based macro called
DISK

_

_
THIS() and the This pointer to the EFI
DISK
IO
_
_
_
PROTOCOL to retrieve the
DISK
IO
PRIVATE
_
_
_
DATA private context data structure.

}
The Stop() function from the EFI
DRIVER
BINDING
_
_
_
PROTOCOL uses the same CR() based macro to retrieve the
private context data structure. The only difference is that the This pointer is not passed into the Stop()
function. Instead, the Stop() function uses ControllerHandle to retrieve one of the produced protocols
and then uses the CR() based macro with that protocol interface pointer to retrieve the private context
data structure.

9 Driver Binding Protocol
The Driver Binding Protocol provides services to do the following:
Connect a driver to a controller.
Disconnect a driver from a controller.
UEFI drivers following the UEFI driver model are required to implement the Driver Binding Protocol. This
requirement includes the following drivers:
Device drivers
Bus drivers
Hybrid drivers
R oot bridge driver, service drivers, and initializ ing drivers do not produce this protocol.
The Driver Binding Protocol is the most important protocol that a driver produces. It is the one protocol
used by the UEFI boot services ConnectController() and DisconnectController() . These UEFI boot services are
used by the UEFI boot manager to connect the console and boot devices required to boot an operating
system. The implementation of the Driver Binding Protocol varies depending upon the driver's category .
Chapter 6 of this guide describes the various driver categories.

9.1 Driver Binding Protocol Implementations
};
UEFI Drivers declare a global variables for the Driver Binding Protocol instances produced. The
ImageHandle and DriverBindingHandle fields are pre-initializ ed to NULL . A UEFI Driver can initializ e the
ImageHandle and DriverBindingHandle fields in the driver entry point, or use the EDK II library UefiLib
functions to help initializ e UEFI Drivers that fill and initializ e the ImageHandle and DriverBindingHandle
fields automatically . The V ersion field must be initializ ed by the UEFI Driver. Higher V ersion values signify
a newer driver. This field is a 32-bit value, but the values 0x0-0x0F and 0xFFFFFFF0- 0xFFFFFFFF are
reserved for UEFI drivers written by OEMs. IHVs may use the values 0x10-0xFFFFFFEF . Each time a new
version of a UEFI driver is released, the V ersion field must be increased. The following example shows
how a Driver Binding Protocol is typically declared in a driver.
Example 123-Driver Binding Protocol declaration
# include <Uefi.h>
# include <Protocol/DriverBinding.h>
EFI
DRIVER
BINDING
_
_
_
PROTOCOL gAbcDriverBinding = {
AbcSupported, // Supported()
AbcStart, // Start()
AbcStop, // Stop()
0x10, // Version
NULL, // ImageHandle
NULL // DriverBindingHandle };
The implementations of the Driver Binding Protocol change in complexity depending on the driver type. A
device driver is the simplest to implement. A bus driver or a hybrid driver may be more complex because
it has to manage both the bus controller and child controllers.
The EFI
DRIVER
BINDING
_
_
_
PROTOCOL is installed onto the driver's image handle. It is possible for a driver to
produce more than one instance of the Driver Binding Protocol. All additional instances of the Driver
Binding Protocol must be installed onto new handles.
The Driver Binding Protocol can be installed directly using the UEFI Boot Service
InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() . However, the EDK II library UefiLib also provides a number of helper
functions to install the Driver Binding Protocol and the optional UEFI Driver Model related protocols. The
following helper functions are covered in more detail in Chapter 7:
EfiLibInstallDriverBinding()
EfiLibInstallAllDriverProtocols()
EfiLibInstallDriverBindingComponentName2()
EfiLibInstallAllDriverProtocols2()
If an error is generated when installing any of the Driver Binding Protocol instances, the entire driver
should fail and return a error status such as EFI
_
ABORTED . If a UEFI Driver implements the Unload() feature,
any Driver Binding Protocol instances installed in the driver entry point must be uninstalled in the
Unload() function.

9.2 Driver Binding Protocol T emplate
9.2 Driver Binding Protocol Template
The implementation of the Driver Binding Protocol for a specific driver is typically found in the file
<<DriverName>> .c. This file contains the instance of the EFI
DRIVER
BINDING
_
_
_
PROTOCOL along with the
implementation of the Supported() , Start() , and Stop() services. Appendix A contains the template for a
UEFI Driver and includes the declaration of the Driver Binding Protocol instance, the Driver Binding
Protocol services and the driver entry point that uses the EDK II library UefiLib functions to install the
Driver Binding Protocol into the handle database and complete the initializ ation of the Driver Binding
Protocol data fields.
The Supported() , Start() , and Stop() services are covered in detail in the EFI Driver Binding Protocol
section of the UEFI Specification. Also included are code examples and the detailed algorithms to
implement these services for device drivers and bus drivers If a UEFI Driver produces multiple instances
of the Driver Binding Protocol, they are all installed in the driver entry point. Each instance of the Driver
Binding Protocol is implemented using the same guidelines. The different instances may share worker
functions to reduce the siz e of the driver.
The Supported() service performs a quick check to see if a driver supports a controller. The Supported()
service must not modify the state of the controller because the controller may already be managed by
a different driver. If the Supported() service passes, the Start() service is called to ask the driver to bind
to a specific controller. The Stop() service does the opposite of Start() . It disconnects a driver from a
controller and frees any resources allocated in the Start() services.
TIP: Although the thought of initializ ing something as soon as it is supported in the Supported() service
of the driver seems to make sense, the Supported() service is intended only to be a quick check to find
out if a driver can make a connection to the specified controller, find out if it has already been called
(started and in use), or if it is in use exclusively by another component. The Supported() service must
return an error if the controller is already in use or is in use exclusively by another component.
Initializ ing or modifying tasks should only be done in the Start() service of the driver, not in the
Supported() service.
Tip: This guide provides additional recommendations for implementing the Driver Binding Protocol for
devices on industry standard busses such as PCI, USB, SCSI, and SA T A. Please see the chapter on the
specific bus type for additional details
-----

None of the Driver Binding Protocol services are allowed to use the console I/O protocols. A UEFI Driver
may use the DEBUG() and ASSERT() macros from the EDK II library DebugLib to send messages to the
standard error console if it is active. These macros are usually enabled during UEFI Driver development
and are disabled when a UEFI Driver is released.

Once a Driver Binding Protocol is implemented, it can be tested use UEFI Shell commands. Use the UEFI
Shell to load a UEFI Driver into memory and verify that the Driver Binding Protocol has been installed into
the Handle Database correctly . The UEFI Shell also provides commands to connect a driver to a device
exercising the Supported() and Start() services, disconnect a driver from a device that exercises the
Stop() service, and reconnect a driver to a device that exercises all the Driver Binding Protocol services.
The details on each UEFI Shell command that may be used to test UEFI Drivers can be found in Chapter

Full testing of a UEFI Driver is performed by booting UEFI operating systems and running the UEFI Self

The Service Binding Protocol is not associated with a single GUID value. Instead, each Service Binding
Protocol GUID value is paired with another protocol providing a specific set of services. The protocol
interfaces for all Service Binding Protocols are identical and contain the services CreateChild() and
DestroyChild() . When CreateChild() is called, a new handle is created with the associated protocol
installed. When DestroyChild() is called, the associated protocol is uninstalled and the handle is freed.

The Service Binding Protocol feature is required only if the associated protocol requires a Service
Binding Protocol to produce its services and it defines a GUID value for that Service Binding Protocol.
The table above lists the protocols defined in the UEFI Specification requiring the Service Binding
Protocol feature. None of the other protocols defined by the UEFI Specification require a Service Binding
Protocol.
For new protocols, a decision must be made to determine if the new protocol requires a Service Binding
Protocol. The Driver Binding Protocol is usually sufficient for managing devices on common bus
topologies and for the simple layering of protocols on a single device. When more complex tree or graph
topologies are required and, with the expectation that services of the new protocol be required by
multiple consumers, a Service Binding Protocol should be considered.

10.2 Service Driver
If the UEFI Driver is a Service Driver, the Service Binding Protocol is installed in the driver entry point. The
following example shows an implementation of a Service Binding Protocol that is installed into the
Handle Database in the driver entry point. A Service Binding Protocol is always paired with another
protocol so, for this example, the paired protocol is the ABC
PROTOCOL .
_
Global variables are declared for the handle on which the Service Binding Protocol is installed, the
instance of the Service Binding Protocol, and an instance of the ABC
PROTOCOL . The ABC
PROTOCOL instance is
_
_
installed onto a new handle every time the Service Binding Protocol service CreateChild() is called. The
ABC
_
PROTOCOL is uninstalled from a child handle every time the Service Binding Protocol service
DestroyChild() is called.

11 UEFI Driver and Controller Names
11 UEFI Driver and Controller Names
Both Component Name Protocols are optional features that allow UEFI Drivers following the UEFI Driver
Model to provide a localiz ed Unicode name string for the UEFI Driver and the devices the UEFI Driver
manages. Use of these protocols depends on the UEFI Driver Model concepts. Service Drivers, R oot
Bridge Drivers, and Initializ ing Drivers never produce the Component Name Protocols. Implementation of
this optional feature is recommended for all UEFI Drivers that follow the UEFI Driver Model.
Note: Human-readable names should be limited to about 40 Unicode characters in length. This makes
it easier for consumers of this protocol to display these names on standard console devices.
The Component Name Protocol and the Component Name 2 Protocol are very similar. The only
difference is the format of language code passed into the protocol services to request the name of a
UEFI Driver or the name of a device that a UEFI Driver manages. The use of a language code allows the
implementation of the Component Name Protocols to provide names of drivers and devices in many
different languages.
The Component Name Protocol uses ISO 639-2 language codes (i.e. eng , fra ). The Component Name 2
Protocol uses RFC 4646 language codes (i.e. en , en-US , fr ). If names are provided for platforms
conforming to the EFI 1.10 Specification, the Component Name s Protocol is required. If names are
provided for platforms that conforming to the UEFI 2.0 Specification or above, the Component Name 2
Protocol is required. Since the only difference is the language code for the names, UEFI Drivers required
to provide names typically produce both protocols and the both use the same underlying functions and
Unicode name strings.
The Component Name Protocols are installed onto handles in the driver entry point of a UEFI Driver.
Chapter 7 describes details on the EDK II library UefiLib that provides helper functions to initializ e UEFI
Drivers following the UEFI Driver Model including installation of Component Name Protocols.
Component Name Protocols may be used by a UEFI Boot Manager to display human readable names for
drivers and devices in a specific language. A platform vendor may also take advantage of Component
Name Protocols from UEFI Applications, such as system utilities or diagnostics, when human readable
names of UEFI drivers or devices are required.
The UEFI Shell provides several commands that use the Component Name Protocols. For example, the
drivers command displays the inventory of UEFI drivers in a platform and uses the Component Name
Protocols to display the name of a UEFI Driver if the UEFI Driver produced the Component Name
Protocols. Likewise, the UEFI Shell command devices displays the inventory of devices in a platform and
uses the Component Name Protocols to display the name of the devices if a UEFI Driver managing the
device produced the Component Name Protocols.
If a controller is managed by more than one UEFI Driver, there may be multiple instances of the
Component Name Protocols that apply to a single controller. The consumers of the Component Name
Protocols have to decide how the multiple drivers providing names are presented to the user. For
example, a PCI bus driver may produce a name for a PCI slot such as "PCI Slot #2,
" and the driver for a
SCSI adapter that is inserted into that same PCI slot may produce a name like "X YZ SCSI Host
Controller.
" Both names describe the same physical device from each driver's perspective, and both
names are useful depending on how they are used.

Install all the Component Name Protocols in the driver entry point.
If the UEFI Driver supports the unload feature, uninstall all the Component Name Protocols in the
Unload() function.
The Component Name Protocols provide names in one or more languages. At a minimum, the protocols
should support the English language. The Component Name Protocols advertise the languages they
supports in a data field called SupportedLanguages. This data filed is a null-terminated ASCII string that
contains one or more 3 character ISO 639-2 language codes with no separator character. The
Component Name 2 Protocol also advertises the languages it supports in a data field called
SupportedLanguages. This data filed is a null-terminated ASCII string that contains one or more RFC
4646 language codes separated by semicolons (';').
A consumer of the Component Name Protocols may parse the SupportedLanguages data field to
determine if the protocol supports a language in which the consumer is interested. This data field can
also be used by the implementation of the Component Name Protocols to see if names are available in
the requested language.
For reference, Example 126, below, shows the protocol interface structure for the Component Name
Protocol and Example 127 shows the protocol interface structure for the Component Name 2 Protocol.
Both are composed of the two services called GetDriverName() and GetControllerName() and a data field
called SupportedLanguages

The implementations of the Component Name Protocols change in complexity depending on the type of
UEFI Driver Model driver and the specific Component Name Protocol features implemented. A device
driver is the simplest to implement. A bus driver or a hybrid driver may be more complex because it may
provide names for both the bus controller and the child controllers. These implementations are
discussed later in this section.

InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() . However, the EDK II library UefiLib provides a number of helper functions
to install the Component Name Protocols. The helper functions covered in more detail in Chapter 7 are:

11.1 Component Name Protocol Implementations
If an error is generated installing any of the Component Name Protocol instances the entire driver
should fail and return an error status such as EFI
_
ABORTED . If a UEFI Driver implements the Unload()
feature, any Component Name Protocol instances installed in the driver entry point must be uninstalled
in the Unload() function.
The simplest implementation of the Component Name Protocols provides the name of the UEFI Driver.
The next most complex implementation is that for a device driver providing both the name of the UEFI
Driver and the names of the controllers under UEFI Driver management. The most complex
implementation is that of a bus or a hybrid driver producing names for the UEFI Driver, names for the
bus controllers it is managing, and names for the child controllers the driver has produced. All three of
these implementations are discussed in the sections that follow .
The EDK II library UefiLib provides functions to simplify the implementation of the Component Name
Protocols. These library functions provide services to register Unicode strings in a table, lookup Unicode
strings in a table, and free tables of Unicode strings. Some UEFI Drivers have fixed names for the UEFI
Driver itself and the controllers that they manage. Other UEFI Drivers may dynamically create names
based on information retrieved from the platform or the controller itself . The EDK II library UefiLib
functions managing tables of Unicode strings are:
LookupUnicodeString()
LookupUnicodeString2()
AddUnicodeString()
AddUnicodeString2()
FreeUnicodeStringTable()
UEFI Drivers producing dynamic names for controllers or children register those dynamic names in the
Driver Binding Protocol Start() function and are freed in the Driver Binding Stop() function. In addition,
dynamic name tables require extra fields in the driver's private context data structure pointing to the
dynamic name tables. See Chapter 8 of this guide for details on the design of private context data
structures.

11.2 GetDriverName() Implementations
11.2 GetDriverName() Implementations
The GetDriverName() service retrieves the name of a UEFI Driver. It may be used to retrieve the name of a
UEFI Driver even if the UEFI Driver is not managing any devices. Example 129, below, shows a typical
implementation of the GetDriverName() service for the Component Name 2 Protocol along with a table of
Unicode strings for the UEFI Driver name in English, French, and Spanish. The recommended
implementation style shown here allows the same GetDriverName() service implementation to be shared
between the Component Name Protocol and the Component Name 2 Protocol. The UefiLib function
LookupUnicodeString2() supports looking up strings using either ISO 639-2 or RFC 4646 language code
formats.
The static table of driver names contains two elements per entry . The first is an ASCII string containing
one or more language codes separated by ';' characters. The language codes may be in the ISO639-2
or the RFC 4646 format.
The second element is a Unicode string representing the name of the UEFI Driver for the set of
languages specified by the first element. The static table is terminated by two NULL elements. The
format is very siz e efficient because each Unicode string name for the UEFI Driver can be associated
with many language codes.

The Component Name Protocols are available only for devices currently under a driver's management.
Because UEFI supports connecting the minimum number of drivers and devices required to establish

11.3.1 Device Drivers
11.3.1 Device Drivers
Device drivers implementing GetControllerName() must verify that ChildHandle is NULL and that
ControllerHandle represents a device the device driver is currently managing. In addition,
GetControllerName() must verify that the requested Language is in the set of languages the UEFI Driver
supports. The example below shows the steps required to check these parameters. If the checks pass,
the name of the controller is returned. In this specific example, the driver opens the PCI I/O Protocol in
its Driver Binding Start() function. This is why gEfiPciIoProtocolGuid is used in the call to the EDK II Library
UefiLib function EfiTestManagedDevice() that checks to see if the UEFI Drivers providing the GetControllerName()
service is currently managing ControllerHandle. Just like the GetDriverName() example in the previous

If the private context structure is required, use the UEFI Boot Service OpenProtocol() to open one of the
protocols on ControllerHandle produced by the UEFI Driver and then use a CR() based macro to retrieve
a pointer to the private context structure.
Some device drivers can extract name information from the devices they manage and are then able to
provide more specific device names. The dynamic generation of controller names does increase the
complexity of the UEFI Driver implementation, but it may provide users with the detailed information they
require to identify a specific device. For example, a driver for a mass storage device may be able to
produce a static name such as "Hard Disk,
" but a more specific name, such as "X YZ Manufacturer SA T A
Model 123 Hard Disk"
, may be much more useful.
T o support the dynamic generation of controller names, a few additional steps must be taken. First, a
pointer to the dynamic table of names must be added to the private context data structure for the
controllers a device driver manages. The example below shows the addition of an EFI
UNICODE

The next update is to the Start() service of the Driver Binding Protocol. It needs to add a controller
name in each supported language to ControllerNameT able in the private context data structure. Use
the UefiLib function AddUnicodeString2() to add one or more names to a table. The ControllerNameT able
must be initializ ed to NULL before the first name is added.
The following example shows the addition of an English name to a dynamically allocated table of
Unicode names. If more than one language is supported, then AddUnicodeString2() is called for each
language. The construction of the Unicode string for each language is not covered here. The format of
names stored with devices varies depending on the bus type, and the translation from a bus-specific
name format to a Unicode string cannot be standardiz ed.

The Stop() service of the Driver Binding Protocol also needs to be updated. When a request is made for
a driver to stop managing a controller, the table of controller names built in the Start() service must be
freed. Use the UEFI driver library function FreeUnicodeStringTable() to free the table of controller names.
The code to add to the Driver Binding Protocol Stop() service follows. The private context data structure
is required by the Stop() service so the private context data structure can be freed. The call to
FreeUnicodeStringTable() should be made just before the private context data structure is freed.
Example 134-Freeing a dynamic controller name table
# include <Uefi.h>
# include <Library/UefiLib.h>

_

FreeUnicodeStringTable (Private->ControllerNameTable);
Lastly, the GetControllerName() service is slightly different because the dynamic table of controller names
from the private context structure is used instead of the static table of controller names. Because the
table of controller names is now maintained in the private context data structure, the private context
data structure needs to be retrieved based on the parameters passed into GetControllerName() . This
retrieval is achieved by looking up a protocol that the driver has produced on ControllerHandle and
using a pointer to that protocol and a CR() macro to retrieve a pointer to the private context data
structure. The private context data structure can then be used with the UefiLib function
LookupUnicodeString2() to look up the controller's name in the dynamic table of controller names.
The example below shows the GetControllerName() service that retrieves the controller name from a
dynamic table stored in the private context data structure.

11.3.2 Bus Drivers and Hybrid Drivers
11.3.2 Bus Drivers and Hybrid Drivers
There are many levels of support a bus driver or hybrid driver may provide for the Component Name
Protocols. These drivers can choose to provide a driver name as described in the section of this
chapter on GetDriverName() . They can also choose to provide names for the bus controllers they manage
and to not provide any names for the children they produce (such as the device drivers described the
previous section). This discussion explains what bus drivers and hybrid drivers need to do to provide
human-readable names for the child handles they produce. The human-readable names for child
handles can be provided through static or dynamic controller name tables.
Note: It is recommended that bus drivers and hybrid drivers provide controller names for both the bus
controller and the child controllers these types of drivers produce. Implementing controller names for
only the bus controller or only the child controllers is discouraged.
Bus drivers and hybrid drivers implementing the Component Name Protocols must verify that
ControllerHandle and ChildHandle represent a device the driver is currently managing. In addition,
GetControllerName() must verify the requested Language is in the set of languages the UEFI Driver
supports. The following example shows the steps required to check these parameters. If these checks
pass, the controller name is returned in the requested language. In this specific example, the driver
opens the PCI I/O Protocol in its Driver Binding Start() function. This is why gEfiPciIoProtocolGuid is used in
the call to the EDK II Library UefiLib function EfiTestManagedDevice() that checks to see if the UEFI Drivers
providing the GetControllerName() service is currently managing ControllerHandle. If the private context
structure is required, then typically the UEFI Boot Service OpenProtocol() is used to open one of the
protocols on ControllerHandle that the UEFI Driver produced and then uses a CR() based macro to
retrieve a pointer to the private context structure.
Note: If ChildHandle is NULL, a request is made for the name of the bus controller. If ChildHandle is not
NULL, a request is made for the name of a child controller managed by the UEFI Driver.

The static tables for the controller names and the child names can be substituted with dynamic tables.
This substitution requires the private context structure to be updated along with the Start() and Stop()
services of the Driver Binding Protocol. The previous section explains how this update is done for the
controller names. The exact same technique can be applied to child controllers.

12 UEFI Driver Configuration
12 UEFI Driver Configuration
The configuration of UEFI Drivers is typically provided through HII. If a UEFI Driver requires interaction
with a user to properly configure a device for use in the UEFI preboot environment, HII packages must
be registered and the HII Config Access Protocol must be implemented. The requirement for HII
packages and the HII Config Access Protocol applies to UEFI Drivers required to be compatible with
platforms conformant with the UEFI 2.1 Specification or higher. This chapter focuses on guidelines for
UEFI Drivers required to produce HII based configuration methods.
If a UEFI Driver is required to be compatible with platforms conformant with the UEFI 2.0 Specification,
the Driver Configuration 2 Protocol must be implemented. If a UEFI Driver is required to be compatible
with platforms conformant with the UEFI 1.1 Specification, the Driver Configuration Protocol must be
implemented.
UEFI platform firmware supporting HII provides an HII forms browser. This component uses UEFI consoles
to display configuration forms to the user and allows the user to navigate between forms and within
forms to answer questions related to the configuration of devices.

EDK II Driver W riter's Guide for UEFI 2.3.1[DRAFT]
12.1 HII overview
12.1 HII overview
A UEFI driver is not allowed to directly invoke a platform's forms browser. Instead, a UEFI Driver provides
sets of forms (the equivalent of W eb pages) to HII. If and when the forms browser is run, the web pages
are displayed and configuration takes place. The benefits of using forms instead of the Simple T ext
Input Protocol and Simple T ext Output Protocols include that:
The forms allow use of a pre-existing GUI―the system already has a browser. This means a UEFI
Driver can take advantage of the browser's features and allows the system to have a more
consistent look and feel for the user.
The forms are device-neutral. The browser can manage the forms appropriately for any device―for
instance, a smart phone versus a laptop.
The forms allow for remote configuration of devices. Instead of requiring that the user to go the
physical machine and press (for example) Ctrl-Alt-F4, the text input can be handled remotely via the
browser.
HII is designed to enable support of the data structures required to support fully localiz ed text and
graphical user interfaces to the user. This consists of four types of support:

1. Keyboard: HII supports keyboard mappings―the keyboard reflects the language the user is expecting
to use. For example, French and English mappings differ in the Q, A, and Z keys. K eyboards simply
return the location of the key, not its Unicode value. The HII support for key mapping allows
translation from key location to Unicode value. There is no support for IMEs.
2. Fonts: HII supports fonts for the approximately 37,000 Unicode printable characters in Unicode UCS-
2 The system carries the Latin-1 (W estern European) character set. Other characters must be
provided if they are to be displayed. HII also supports narrow and wide characters to support
logographic languages (such as Chinese, Japanese, and K orean).
3. Strings: HII expects strings to be compressed Unicode stored by language. Drivers reference strings
by IDs, which requires less storage. The actual string selected is defined by the ID and by the
selected language.
4. Forms: HII defines its own forms language known as IFR. Although similar to web-based forms
languages (such as HTML), IFR is stored in binary . IFR supports the usual tags, headers, and so on,
found in a normal forms markup language. However, IFR also has special support for items common
to configuration including multiple defaults and context-sensitive help. Unlike most forms languages,
HII refers to strings via ID, so the same form can be used for multiple languages. HII also supports a
rich set of operations for validating results. If all else fails, HII can reference callbacks into the
submitting driver's code.
Note: IFR is a variable-length encoding of HTML-like tags. While experts can write in this language (a bit
like using DBs to write assembly language), most developers use a high level language known as VFR.
VFR compiles into IFR and makes writing UEFI forms similar to writing HTML. The EDK II build tools provide
full support for VFR along with a VFR to IFR compiler.
HII data is stored in a central HII database dynamically created upon each reboot. HII protocols allow for
a driver's HII data to be submitted, manipulated, and extracted.
Configuration in a UEFI system is the province of a single setup browser. Drivers submit their HII data to
the HII protocols. The browser then parses through the forms in the same way an internet browser
would parse web data. The setup browser communicates with the drivers to obtain current

12.1.1 HII Database and Package Lists
12.1.1 HII Database and Package Lists
The HII database is built dynamically as the system boots. A UEFI Driver is required to register lists of HII
packages into the HII Database. A package list is a list of packages providing different types of binary
data. The data types supported include font, string, image, keyboard, and forms data.
Note: The package could also contain some keyboard data but keyboard layouts are typically outside
the scope of a driver (and typically up to the platform to determine). For example, keyboard data could
represent the French keyboard, a simplified set of Hiragana and Katakana characters for a Japanese
keyboard, and so on. The Unicode values of keyboard data are mapped to the characters of each
supported language and displayed to the screen.
The goal of the package is to create a single form with multiple sets of strings. For example, the goal for
fonts is to create a single form with multiple sets of strings, each set for a different supported
language. The sets of strings are published to the HII database, which also contains the strings, fonts,
and characters from other drivers. The setup browser can then access the HII Database to display the
forms in the appropriate language and font.
In general, data in a package is not modified after it is registered. For example, data that probably
won't change during configuration include the questions that are presented to a user, the layout of the
forms, the font list, and so on.

12.2 General steps for implementing HII functionality
12.2 General steps for implementing HII functionality
T o include HII functionality in a driver, follow these general steps:
1. Decide if the user should be allowed to change configuration data.
2. Identify a set of options that can be changed. These options are stored in NVRAM. The NVRAM
storage may be either local to the device being configured (recommended), or it may be global to
the platform such as UEFI V ariables (not recommended). UEFI V ariables must be used only to store
configuration data for UEFI Drivers integrated into a platform.
3. Define the C data structure for the configurable data. Drivers have flexibility on how they process
configurable data. For example, data can be managed as name, value pairs or as a data structure.
The full C data structure is defined in a .h file for the UEFI Driver usually in <<DriverName>> .h.
4. Determine the order of the questions presented to the user-for example, the order in which to
present the fields and their values. For example, select on or off, yes or no, or enter a specific
value, and so on. This information is typically stored in the file called <<DriverName>> .Vfr. The order in
which the information is listed in the <<DriverName>> .Vfr file is the order in which each configurable
field is displayed in the form.
TIP: When designing questions, remember that the way the user sees the data may vary
considerably depending on the device used. For example, it could vary from a few lines on a plasma
display on the front panel of a home electronics device to a full, rich GUI interface on a remote
console.
5. Define the strings for the form including the title of the form, help information for the form title; the
titles for each configurable field and the help information (if any) for each configurable field. This
information is typically stored in the <<DriverName>> .Uni. The example below shows a portion of the
Unicode string file from a sample driver in the MdeModulePkg on the path
MdeModulePkg/Universal/DriverSampleDxe.

6. Determine if the driver must be localiz ed: Does it need to support more than one language? If so, the
strings must be translated. Determine if the languages can be displayed using the Latin-1 character set
(European). If not, obtain fonts for the characters in the languages the driver supports.
At this point, a .uni file, a .vfr file, and a .h file have been produced. Typically, there is only one .uni file and one .vfr
file per driver. More than one .uni file may be required if the driver presents multiple forms or menus. More than one .vfr f
ile may be required in certain circumstances, for example, to simplify maintenance by holding an area of functionality in a se
parate .vfr file that changes often.
7. Implement HII Config Access Protocol to retrieve and save configuration information associated with
the HII forms. The implementation of the HII Config Access Protocol is typically found in the file
HiiConfigAccess.c. Appendix A contains a template for a HiiConfigAccess.c file for a UEFI Driver. The
Config Access Protocol contains three services: ExtractConfig(), R outeConfig(), and DriverCallback(). The
following example shows the definition of the HII Config Access Protocol for reference. When the HII
setup browser is called, these functions are used to retrieve and store configuration setting as well as
to retrieve default settings.
Note: This is still the init section. The driver has not attached to those protocols yet.

packages.
9. If the UEFI Driver does not follow the UEFI Driver Model, install the HII Config Access Protocol from the
driver entry point following the example in Chapter 7. If the UEFI Driver does follow the UEFI Driver Model,
the HII Config Access Protocol is installed in the Driver Binding Protocol Start() function on each handle
the UEFI Driver manages and provides configuration.
At this point, the driver's init part is done. When the form is displayed to the user, the calls to the HII
Config Access Protocol are made to retrieve and save configuration settings. It is up to the
implementation of the HII Config Access Protocol to store configuration settings in NVRAM so they are
available the next time the platform boots.

Some protocols must be clearly understood in order to successfully implement a UEFI driver with HII

Protocol produced by a UEFI Driver. They need not be used in any particular order. The MdeModulePkg
provides the UefiHiiServicesLib that automatically looks up consumed HII protocols and makes them
available to a UEFI Driver requiring the services they provide. A UEFI platform is not required to produce
all of these protocols. The following is the list of protocols and the global variable provided by the
UefiHiiServicesLib . If a global variable is set to NULL , it means that the platform does not produce that
specific protocol. UEFI Drivers must handle all platform configurations, so it is important for a UEFI Driver
to continue to function both when an HII related protocol is present and when an HII related protocol is
absent.

12.3.1 HII Database Protocol and HII String Protocol
12.3.1 HII Database Protocol and HII String Protocol
Use the database protocol to submit the package of strings, fonts, forms, and so on, to the HII
database. It is the most important of the HII protocols. Because the package is created at build time,
and most of the package does not change, the driver does not have to call much later. This can
significantly speed up boot time.
The strings protocol allows the general purpose forms to adapt to the configuration of a specific
platform. This includes configuration information typed in by the user. The forms themselves are created
by the VFR during build.
Basically, the string and database protocols facilitate database and string management. The browser
simply gets things out of the database after the driver uses the set functions to put data into the
database. The browser doesn't need to know how to parse the database or even know how strings are
stored; it needs to know only how to parse the forms.
The EDK II provides a library, in the MdeModulePkg , called HiiLib that provides helper functions to simplify
the use of the HII Database and HII String protocols. It also provides services to dynamically generate
forms.
12.3.1.1 HII Database Protocol
HII data is contained in HII packages. For example, A driver might have a string package, a form
package, and a small font package. HII supports package lists as a way to combine HII packages to
create a single data structure for all the user interface HII data necessary for the driver. Rather than
requiring the driver to split the packs up to, for example, provide the string pack to the string protocol
and the font pack to the font protocol, the HII Database Protocol consumes the entire package list and
portions it out to the various parts of the HII database. The package list format is described in the
Human Interface Infrastructure Overview chapter of the UEFI Specification.
When a package list is submitted to the database (via NewPackageList), an ID, known as an HII handle,
is associated with the data. This handle is required to manipulate the pack list's data to ensure
uniqueness. For example, if two drivers submit string packs to the database, each have a string with an
ID of 1 but they are different. The handle indicates which string with an ID of 1 to access.
One parameter to NewPackageList deserves special attention: DriverHandle. The driver handle indicates
the handle on which the driver has put an instance of the CONFIGURA TION
ACCESS
PROTOCOL. This
_
_
protocol is used to obtain ("extract") the current configuration of a driver and to provide new
configurations to it.
UpdatePackageList allows a driver to associate more than one package list with the same handle. This
may simplify complex configurations by splitting the package into a common piece and additional
configurations depending upon the cards SKU.
The Database protocol also supports methods to extract pieces from the database up to and including
the entire database as well as ListPackageLists and ExportPackageLists. These functions are rarely
useful for a driver but are the mechanisms by which the system places the HII data into the system
table and also how the Setup browser obtains the data used to present its screens. The database
protocol also supports notification functions for consumers of database data so they can determine if
new packages have been added or existing ones removed.
Questions commonly asked include: Why are there individual protocols for some package types? Why
isn't there a single protocol? The main reason is that the number of functions required became
unwieldy . A secondary reason is that, for some smaller implementations, subsets of HII could be
implemented. In reality this has not occurred.

EDK II Driver W riter's Guide for UEFI 2.3.1[DRAFT]
12.3.1 HII Database Protocol and HII String Protocol
The keyboard packages were judged as being simple enough to leave in the database protocol.
K eyboards are abstracted using a data structure per key . Each data structure defines the key code to
which the data structure refers, as well as the unmodified Unicode weight and the weights when
modified with Shift, Alt, and Shift + Alt. Only the keys that vary from the standard US English layout need
be specified. Certain keys, such as NumLock, may also be assigned special functions.
12.3.1.2 HII String Protocol
The String Protocol consumes string packs. It also allows manipulation of strings already in the
database, even if they were submitted via the database protocol.
It is quite common for a driver to need to manipulate certain strings when its data is in the HII
database. Consider the case of a media card with attached mass storage devices. When the driver for
the media card is created, the identification data of the mass storage devices attached aren't known.
That data is derived when the card's driver is invoked, generally at Start() .
If the driver is to provide the mass storage device types to the setup browser, it is common to allocate
empty strings so the build allocates string IDs to the strings. The driver can then parse the string pack
to modify strings updating them with the drive id data itself and then submit the string pack. This is
complex and tedious because the string packs are stored to be space efficient, not to be easily
accessible. The String protocol already knows how to parse the string pack, however, and does provide
methods to modify strings by ID. This makes the job of updating strings for dynamically derived data an
easy one. Simply submit the string packs to the database, then modify the few strings that change
dynamically . Blank strings can be checked for in IFR so empty channels don't have to be displayed.
12.3.1.3 Adding data to the HII database at boot time
There is more than one way to add information to the database. A crude way of adding information to
the HII database is by using individual protocols to specify the fonts, strings, and forms. A better way is
to use the HII Database Protocol. This protocol provide services to register the strings pack, fonts pack,
forms pack, and so on, all at once. Because most of the package is static data, the driver does not
have to do much work later during boot.
Note: If the VFR compiler is used as part of the build, the package created may be published with this
protocol.
Also, note that the database is not complete at build time. The driver cannot know all the data it needs
about the end-user's specific system hardware or other devices connected to the hardware. For
example, the driver can't know a specific platform's MAC address at build time, which specific mass
storage devices are attached via SCSI, each mass storage device's version information, and so on. That
type of information is acquired during setup. During setup or boot, the package for the HII database
must be updated.
Although data may be modified before being submitted to the database, that process is both difficult
and convoluted. Use the SetString() function in the HII String Protocol instead.
For configurable data, or for data not available at build time, use a question mark in the package for
each of the blank fields. During boot, the driver requests that information. Use the set string
functionality of the HII String Protocol to specify the ID of the new package list and update the database
with the new string from the build file.

12.3.1 HII Database Protocol and HII String Protocol
Note: If driver A creates a package list for the database, and another driver B creates another
package list for the database, driver A's string #12 is not the same as driver B's string #12.
12.3.1.4 Update the database via the byte offset of a configurable field
T o modify a form after build-time, include a comment line (a macro for the VFR compiler) in the form's
source code. The comment line does not generate code in the form. It simply indicates the byte offset
of the value which does change the platformspecific information. The driver does not need to know how
to parse the whole form to find that value. Instead, a driver can use the offset to find out where to edit
the form.
T ake the example of a SCSI driver with 2 drives specified as the default. In this example, the end-user
platform actually has 3 drives. The driver searches for the appropriate comment to find the offset and
the compiler tells the driver that the description of the logical unit is at line 437 The driver goes to that
location, adds new forms data for the third drive and "slides" the rest of the configuration forms down.
Essentially, new data is inserted into a newly created hole. Because the Internal Forms Language (IFR)
is decision-independent, there are no fixed addresses in the code so data may be moved from one
location to another relatively easily . The IFR also uses names for references, not pointers. For example,
if 20 bytes of data need to be added at location 437, the 20 bytes can be copied into the new form.
Note: The driver can do a get operation on the whole form or on just the string. The driver can do a get
operation on the string because it uses the existing infrastructure (the platform's browser and other
tools), which already know how to parse the database to find the appropriate data.
12.3.1.5 Using strings to create forms as-needed
Use strings to create forms as needed. For example, most of the time, a SCSI has only 2 drives, but
could have up to 8 Instead of creating a static form with 8 fields, and only 2 filled at boot time, a form
with the 2 required fields can be created dynamically . The other 6 unused fields would not be displayed
until they are actually needed.
12.3.1.6 Using strings to modify forms
In general, about 80% of any given form is static and common across the system's hardware. The other
20% is specific to that platform.
When adding information after build, it is sometimes easier to simply update a form. Other times it's
easier to create a new form and turn it in. In general, a new form should be created if 70-80% of the
information is new or has changed.
The VFR programming language explains how to work with forms and includes tips and suggestions for
modifying forms.
12.3.1.7 HII Database Protocol with Export Package List
The HII Database Protocol provides a service to export all registered packages into an Export Package
List. This includes packages registered by all UEFI Drivers. The Export Package List is not typically used
by UEFI Drivers themselves. Instead, its purpose is to provide a single interface for external entities to
extract the data needed to configure the system remotely .

12.3.2 HII Config R outing Protocol
12.3.2 HII Config Routing Protocol
The Configuration R outing Protocol is not used by UEFI Drivers. However, it is important to understand
its role in the configuration process. This protocol is used by consumers of forms to determine the
current configuration of the tags (questions) associated with the forms and to change the
configuration of the corresponding data.
The data format for both output from the drivers and input into the drivers is Unicode strings of
ampersand separated name=value pairs. Each string is associated with a particular form, and hence, a
particular driver. Specific name=value pairs at the start of a string of data associate the data with a
particular instance of a driver.
This format can seem a little cumbersome at times but does provide a common, well defined mechanism
to present the data. It is useful particularly in cases where the configuration of the system is handled
remotely . It is also useful in cases where the same configuration data is applied to multiple systems,
such as when systems are initially received by an IT department.
The data provided by the driver includes the leading name=value pairs. The data provided by the
configuration program consists of a single string that may be consumed by multiple drivers (hence the
name multi-config string). The routing protocol uses the leading name=value pairs to break-up the
multi-config string and to determine the correct consumer of each of the substrings. Each driver
receives only its own configuration data via the HII Config Access Protocol described below .
The leading name=value pairs (all in upper case only) are:
GUID - The GUID in the Setup Form associated with this data
NAME - The name of the driver
PA TH - The binary device path to the driver's device
A UEFI Driver may describe not only the current configuration but also several alternate configurations.
Each alternate configuration is described by an identifier and preceded by a name=value pair with the
name AL T CFG and the value indicating the alternate configuration in the Form. These are typically
default configurations.
A UEFI driver maps its configuration into an array that is also represented as a C data structure. In this
case, each configurable item is represented by three consecutive name=value pairs:
OFFSET―The byte offset into the structure of the item
WIDTH―The number of bytes the item consumes
V AL UE―The current (or new) configuration of the item
Helper functions map the string into a memory array to be stored by the UEFI Driver. A UEFI Driver may
receive a request for only certain configuration values, in which case only the names (and not the = or
value) are filled in. The driver must fill in the values for the requested names.
If a UEFI Driver receives a configuration string containing incorrect leading name=value pairs, unknown
names or out of bound values, the driver must reject the configuration request. In other words, the
driver always validates the input string.
There is no requirement to include all name=value pairs in a configuration change string. The
configuration associated with all names not mentioned in the string should not change. The UEFI Driver
must ensure that the results of the reconfiguration are valid.
A UEFI Driver must provide a name=value pair parser that is tolerant of different formats of
numbers―0ab, ab, and AB are all the same number. Similarly, the parser must be tolerant of case
changes in names―Fred=5, fred=5, and FRED=5 should all be tolerated.

12.3.2 HII Config R outing Protocol
A UEFI Driver implementation of the HII Config Access Protocol must pay close attention to the memory
allocation and deallocation requirements of the HII Config Access Protocol. Sometimes, the caller
allocates the memory, other times, the callee allocates the memory . See the EFI HII Configuration
Access Protocol section of the UEFI Specification for more details.
12.3.2.1 Remote configuration
Previously, even when configuration is local, every PC BIOS legacy option ROM had to carry its own setup-
this took up a lot of space. With HII, only the platform needs to carry the browser. The driver carries only
the package-the fonts and strings that the browser doesn't know about. For drivers having a significant
amount of configuration, using HII functionality can help reduce the driver's siz e by as much as 20% or
30%.
For example, a platform may require some configuration at runtime. Or a platform may require remote
configuration by an Information T echnology (IT) administrator at a remote server that allows them to
configure some settings, and send those settings back. In order to do this, the management
application typically wants the entire database of information. Such an application sends that database
off to the remote system, which does the configuration via its own setup browser, then sends the data
back. The management application provides configuration changes to the platform that are routed
back to the UEFI Driver managing the device being configured. This means a driver can support remote
configuration without having to implement all the functions that the browser and management
application already provide.
Note: Configuration data, whether configuration is remote or local, does not need to use callbacks. In
fact, a remote browser ignores all the pieces of a form involving callbacks. Once the configuration is on
the end-user platform, callbacks are functional again because they are on a local machine.

12.3.3 HII Config Access Protocol
12.3.3 HII Config Access Protocol
The HII Config Access Protocol is produced by the UEFI driver. It has three key functions that are
published to the HII database. The first two functions are used by the Configuration R outing Protocol to
extract data from drivers and to provide configuration back to the drivers. The format of the
configuration is modeled after the CGI: A Unicode string of ampersand separated name = value pairs
(x=1&y=2&z =3A). The names and values are specified in the forms. Only names are provided for extract
requests. The driver cannot assume that all names in a form are present in a request―the caller may
limit the entries to only those it needs.
Callbacks are the method by which the browser and driver directly communicate with each other. The
forms describe when to invoke callbacks and they provide some context for the callback.
Use callbacks to update dynamic data, such as ambient temperature, fan speed, etc. They should not
be used to modify how items are displayed.
The following three key functions are published to the HII database:
ExtractConfig function: This function is called by the HII engine at the beginning of a particular
form. This function gives the driver a chance to perform tasks before the form is processed by the
HII database engine. For example, the function could test the current NVRAM data structure to
make sure it is not corrupt. This function also allows the browser to display current configuration
information.
Note: The ExtractConfig function eliminates the need to use the previous, tedious method of manually
outputting to the console, reading strings back from the console, and manually interpreting those
strings.
RouteConfig function: This function allows the browser to obtain and change configuration
information upon the exit of the form. It performs the final store and routes the appropriate data
out to whoever needs it. For example, this function copies the current data back to the data
structure in NVRAM. This function processes any changes that the user enters.
Callback function: This function is called when a user makes changes. After the changes are
saved, the original data structure is updated with the new settings.
Note: This is not a callback in the traditional sense. This function is used by the browser to route data
back to the appropriate driver so each driver can process its own configuration.

12.3.4 Rarely used HII protocols
12.3.4 Rarely used HII protocols
There are two rarely used HII protocols: HII Font Protocol, and the HII Image Protocol. Though rarely
used, understanding them is important
12.3.4.1 HII Font Protocol
The HII Font Protocol provides functionality equivalent to the String Protocol but manages fonts instead.
Fonts consist of glyphs, bit-mapped representations of characters. The characters are referred to by
their Unicode weight, which is to say their corresponding binary value. For example, weight 0x0030 is a
"0" (z ero). A font is a series of glyphs bound together by name, siz e and similar visual characteristics.
The default font is the system font, which is 8x16 and 16x16 (for wide characters). Latin-1 characters in
this standard font are provided by the system firmware. If a driver uses other characters, including e.g.
Chinese, K orean, Hindi, Arabic, Hebrew, etc. A driver must provide all of the characters it uses. The build
tools determine the actual characters used. Other fonts are identified by GUID.
TIP: It is strongly recommended that the system font be used for reasons of siz e and consistency .
Unlike strings, fonts are not separated by handle. When a driver provides fonts to the database, the
new glyphs are merged with existing glyphs, provided that they are the same font. This means the
display of a driver's data may use a different driver's font characters.
12.3.4.2 HII Image Protocol
HII provides simple support for images like graphical pictures and simplistic animation. There is no
requirement for browsers to support graphics. The browser in EDK II does not support graphics and
most setup browsers do not support graphics simply because of siz e requirements. The exception is for
splash screens (banners).

HII functionality offers several benefits. One of the biggest is that HII functionality takes advantage of

UEFI Drivers no longer need to include a browser and this simplifies drivers, helps reduce driver siz e,
and helps standardiz e the interface for users. Also, because the forms support language localiz ation,
the driver no longer needs to manually manage language strings. Instead, the HII interface displays
forms as appropriate for the languages specified by the driver writer.

12.4.2 Specifying supported languages
12.4.2 Specifying supported languages
The HII String Protocol allows strings and tokens to be used to specify the supported languages for a
driver. The strings themselves are defined in a separate string file. That file is then published to the HII
Database.
The string file must have at least one language definition and at least one string. If there is only one
language specified, that language is the default. If more than one language is specified, then the first
language listed is always the default language.
Note: It is possible that no languages supported by the system are supported by the driver. In this
case the browser selects the default language and proceeds. It is important to use the secondary
language feature in HII to describe alternate languages to provide maximum flexibility for a set of
strings.
The following snippet from a Unicode string file shows American English (en-US) as the default language
because it is first in the list. The string file includes support for two additional languages, French-
Canadian (fr-CA), and British English (en-UK).
Example 142-Unicode string file with support for multiple languages
# langdef en-US "English"
# langdef fr-FR "Francais"
# langdef en-UK "British"
# string STR
INV
FORM
SET
_
_
_
_
TITLE #language en-US "ABC Information Sample"
# language fr-FR "Mi motor Espade arreglo"
# language en-UK "ABC Information Sample"
Note: It costs the driver almost no processing time to support multiple languages because language
selection is determined at the system level. However, adding support for multiple languages with
additional strings and tokens can increase the siz e of the driver slightly . Adding support for many
languages (for example, 100 or more) could increase the siz e of the driver more significantly .

12.4.3 Specifying configuration information
12.4.3 Specifying configuration information
HII functionality makes it easier to publish configuration information to a database. With HII functionality,
the driver writer specifies the form layout for configuration information. The form layout points to static
strings, as well as to data that is configurable by the user. The driver writer also defines the data
structure of configurable data stored in NVRAM.
The strings are defined in a Unicode file (files with a .uni extension). During the driver's init section, the
driver publishes the list of strings (such as language strings) and forms to the HII database with the HII
handler. The driver also publishes its configuration routing protocols. The actual data structure of
strings and forms is created as part of the build process.
The build tools take the .Uni file and the .Vfr file and produce a data structure. That data structure is
stored in the HII database. Configurable data is stored in NVRAM.
When the HII engine is invoked, it runs the forms, pulls the strings it needs from the string database,
and pulls the configurable settings it needs from NVRAM.
12.4.3.1 Using forms
Prior to HII, there was no standardiz ed way to create forms. Instead, forms were created manually, and
were manually output to the console. HII provides a standard way to create forms, making it easier to
display information. Because HII functionality is standardiz ed via forms, the driver no longer needs to
manage the way users enter data, or worry about parsing the data. The HII engine parses the data to
make sure it is appropriate for the defined field. See the discussion earlier in this section entitled
"General Steps for Implementing HII Functionality .
"
T o create forms, a UEFI Driver with HII functionality should use the VFR programming language and IFR
defined in the Human Interface Infrastructure Overview chapter of the UEFI Specification. R efer to the
VFR Programming Language for information about creating forms. The MdeModulePkg also contains a
sample driver in the paths MdeModulePkg/Universal/DriverSampleDxe and MdeModulePkg/Universal/HiiResourcesSampleDxe
that show example usages of VFR constructs.
12.4.3.2 Storing configuration information in nonvolatile storage
A UEFI Driver should store its configurable information in nonvolatile storage (NVRAM). This configuration
information should be stored with the device so the configuration information travels with the device if it
is moved between platforms.
The exact method for retrieving and storing configuration information on a device is device specific.
T ypically, drivers use the services of a bus I/O protocol to access the resources of a device to retrieve
and store configuration information. For example, if a PCI controller has a flash device attached to it,
the management of that flash device may be exposed through I/O or memory-mapped I/O registers
described in the BARs associated with the PCI device. A PCI device driver can use the Io.Read() ,
Io.Write() , Mem.Read() , or Mem.Write() services of the PCI I/O Protocol to access the flash contents to
retrieve and store configuration settings. Devices that are integrated onto the motherboard or are part
of a FRU may use the UEFI variable Services such as GetVariable() and SetVariable() to store configuration
information.

12.4.4 Making configuration data available to other drivers
12.4.4 Making configuration data available to other drivers
Configuration data is stored in NVRAM. The data structures that contain the static and configurable
data for the driver are typically part of the package published to the HII database. In order to make
configuration data available to other drivers, make sure to do the following:
1. Extract the forms from the form database.
2. Parse the forms for the names of the configurable options.
3. Use the HII Config Access Protocol to extract the data from all drivers.
12.4.4.1 Check validity of configuration options for a specific device
The UEFI Specification defines a CallBack() service in the HII Config Access Protocol. This protocol
interfaces with the VFR language. The callback protocol includes an action, QuestionId , type, value, and
action request. When the user changes a configuration setting, this causes a call back to the driver.
The driver then needs to check to see if the value entered is valid.
The data structure for configuration options is initializ ed via the driver's init entry point. The init reads
the configuration data out of NVRAM and makes sure the data is valid. If any particular variable is
invalid, the value for that variable is reset to its default.
The platform vendor can validate the configuration of all devices in the system before booting. In
addition, the devices can be reset to their default configurations. If the firmware detects a corrupt
configuration then a default configuration may be selected automatically . The platform vendor may
choose to allow the user to select a menu item to force defaults on a specific device or all devices at
once.

its default configuration settings. The default configuration settings may be retrieved using the
ExtractConfig() service of the HII Config Access Protocol. This means the UEFI Driver that produces the
HII Config Access Protocol must support requests for the current configuration settings as well as the
default configuration settings.

12.5 Forms and VFR files
Here is a sample, simplified VFR file. It declares a form set with one from and uses a single variable
store to retrieve and save configuration settings. The form contains a title and four questions:
1. Allows a user to select one of two pre-defined values.
2. Allows the user to type in a string value.
3. Allows the user to type in a numeric value.
4. Allows the user to select a button to reset settings to defaults.

EDK II Driver W riter's Guide for UEFI 2.3.1[DRAFT]
12.6.1 Minimiz e callbacks
12.6.1 Minimize callbacks
There are circumstances in which a callback is required. For example, callbacks are necessary when
real-time data such as a temperature or voltage is required, or when direct password input is required
to unlock a security feature.
However, the callback is useful for an extremely limited number of circumstances and can be used
inappropriately .
Caution: It is very important with UEFI drivers that the use of callbacks is minimiz ed. The use
ofcallbacks can significantly slow down a browser. Callbacks tend to be hard to maintain and are also
typically very buggy . They don't adapt well to various video forms, which becomes an issue for
interoperability between different types of devices. Finally, they cannot be used remotely, which creates
significant problems with remote management of drivers.
There are a number of useful techniques to reduce the use of callbacks. For example, use the rich set
of comparison and calculation operators in VFR to validate input rather than resorting to callbacks.
Also, modify the IFR (the language into which VFR compiles) before handing the IFR to HII. This allows the
IFR to be adapted to the state of the system as the driver finds it. For example, don't use callbacks to
determine attacked devices. Instead, determine the devices when providing the HII and fill in the data
into the VFR.
Note that the HII engine can also do some testing of values, such as for minimum and maximum
limits―a callback is not required for these operations. Instead, these checks are incorporated into the
VFR sources, and the HII engine checks perform the tests against the minimum and maximum values.
String compares may also be performed without the use of a callback.
TIP: Use a callback only when absolutely required, and when no other methods are available to perform
the task. Almost nothing should be a callback.
TIP: Use callbacks only for dynamically changing data. Do not use callbacks for static data.
TIP: Do not use callbacks to format tables or make the interface look nice.
TIP: Do not make assumptions about the way the data returned from the callback is displayed.
Basically, let the HII engine perform as much of the work as possible and rigorously minimiz e the use of
callbacks.
12.6.1.1 Callbacks create issues with remote configuration
One of the biggest issues with remote configuration is the use of callbacks (see the previous discussion
for more information). For example, if configuration changes must be made to thousands of systems at
a remote site, callback functions cannot be used, because the remote systems may be powered down
or otherwise unavailable.

12.6.1 Minimiz e callbacks
TIP: Use a callback only when absolutely required.
12.6.1.2 Callbacks create issues with interoperability
Callbacks are also an issue with regards to interoperability of remote devices. For example, a server
might have a 32x4 plasma display . A browser may be implemented for VFR to support a 32x4 display, but
the callback functions typically do not function well between device types. If a UEFI Driver is intended to
be used in remote configuration scenarios, then avoid the use of callbacks.

12.6.2 Don't reparse the package list
12.6.2 Don't reparse the package list
Space is very important in the firmware. Siz e can be reduced by reparsing the forms and package list.
However, it is better to let the code that already does that kind of parsing perform this task. This code
already exists in the platform, so there is no reason to add it to a driver. In fact, even the browser
should call a GetString() function instead of parsing the string package itself .
TIP: A void writing code that parses the package list.
TIP: When in doubt, submit the package list, then the driver can call the getstring function and set-
string function.

12.6.3 Concentrate on critical aspects of the driver
Often people focus on what they can easily see of a driver, which tends to be the browser, not the
actual driver. However, with HII functionality, a driver no longer needs to include its own browser.
Instead, the driver can take advantage of the platform's browser and other code already written and a
part of the platform.
TIP: Concentrate on the important parts of the driver (what it does), not on the more visible, probably
browser-related, aspects. A UEFI 2.x conformant driver uses the platform's existing browser anyway

12.7 Porting to UEFI HII functionality
HII allows the platform's existing browser to be used to display and manage forms for user input. In
doing so, HII functionality replaces or supplements older protocols:
Driver Configuration Protocol and Driver Configuration 2 Protocol:. If a UEFI Driver is required to only
be compatible with the UEFI 2.1 Specification or higher, then replace the use of these protocols with
HII functionality .
Simple T ext Input Protocol, Simple T ext Output Protocol: UEFI Drivers, in general, are not allowed to
use UEFI console protocols. The one exception is the Driver Configuration Protocol SetOptions()
service. If a UEFI Driver is required to only be compatible with UEFI 2.1 Specification or higher, the
Driver Configuration Protocols are not required and the Simple T ext Input Protocol and Simple T ext
Output Protocol should not be used.
Convert strings used by Driver Configuration Protocol SetOptions() to a .uni file.
Convert questions and other user interactions in Driver Configuration Protocol SetOptions() to a .vfr

13 UEFI Driver Diagnostics
13 UEFI Driver Diagnostics
The Driver Diagnostics Protocols are optional features that allow UEFI Drivers following the UEFI Driver
Model to provide diagnostics for the devices under UEFI Driver management. Use of these protocols
depends on the UEFI Driver Model concepts so Service Drivers, R oot Bridge Drivers, and Initializ ing
Drivers never produce the Driver Diagnostics Protocols.
The Driver Binding Protocol Start() function may perform some quick checks of a device's status, but
checks taking extended time to execute should be provided in a Driver Diagnostic Protocol
implementation. Doing so improves the overall platform boot performance by deferring extensive
diagnostics to a separate protocol not required to execute on every boot.
The Driver Diagnostics Protocol and the Driver Diagnostics 2 Protocol are very similar. The only
difference lies in the type of language code used to specify the language for diagnostic result
messages. The Driver Diagnostic Protocol uses ISO 639-2 language codes (i.e. eng , fra ). The Driver
Diagnostics 2 Protocol uses RFC 4646 language codes (i.e. en , en-US , fr ). For diagnostics provided to
platforms conforming to the EFI 1.10
_
Specification, use the Driver Diagnostics Protocol. For diagnostics
provided to platforms conforming to the UEFI 2.0 Specification or above, use the Driver Diagnostics 2
Protocol. Since the only difference is the language code for the diagnostic message results, UEFI
Drivers required to provide diagnostics typically produce both protocols so the two implementations can
share the same diagnostic algorithms and diagnostic result messages.
The Driver Diagnostics Protocols are installed onto handles in the driver entry point of UEFI Drivers.
Chapter 7 provides details on the EDK II UefiLib library that provides helper functions to initializ e UEFI
Drivers following the UEFI Driver Model, including the installation of the Driver Diagnostics Protocols.
The Driver Diagnostic Protocols may be invoked from a UEFI Boot Manager if a platform provides those
options to a user. A platform vendor can take advantage of Driver Diagnostic Protocol implementations
for devices to improve overall system diagnostics for the user. These protocols may also be invoked
through a UEFI Application that performs diagnostics.
Use the drvdiag command to test the functionality of Driver Diagnostic Protocol implementation and to
diagnose issues on platforms that either build the UEFI Shell in or provide the ability to boot the UEFI
Shell from a boot device. The drvdiag command provides the list of devices that support diagnostic
operations and the ability to run diagnostics on a specific device and report the results.
If a controller is managed by more than one UEFI Driver, there may be multiple instances of the Driver
Diagnostics Protocols that apply to a single controller. The consumers of the Driver Diagnostics
Protocols have to decide how the multiple drivers supporting diagnostics are presented to users so
they can select the desired diagnostic. For example, a PCI bus driver may produce the Driver
Diagnostics Protocol to verify the functionality of a specific PCI slot. The UEFI Driver for a SCSI adapter
inserted into that same PCI slot may produce diagnostics for the SCSI host controller. Both sets of
diagnostics may be useful to a user when testing the platform. The UEFI Shell drvdiag command does
support this use case.
Appendix B contains a table of example drivers from the EDK II along with the features each implement.
The EDK II provides example drivers with full implementations of the Driver Diagnostics Protocols.
Note: The Driver Diagnostics Protocols are used rarely, and platform vendors may or may not invoke
the Driver Diagnostics Protocols.

13.1 Driver Diagnostics Protocol Implementations
13.1 Driver Diagnostics Protocol Implementations
The implementation of the Driver Diagnostics Protocols for a specific driver is typically found
in the file DriverDiagnostics.c. Appendix A contains a template for
DriverDiagnostics.c, a file for a UEFI Driver. This file typically contains the following: - Add global variable
for the EFI
DRIVER

_
PROTOCOL instance to DriverDiagnostics.c.

- Add global variable for the
_
_

Add Static table of diagnostics result messages as Unicode strings to DriverDiagnostics.c .
Implementation of the RunDiagnostics() service
Install all the Driver Diagnostics Protocols in the driver entry point.
If the UEFI Driver supports the unload feature, uninstall all the Driver Diagnostics Protocols in the
Unload() function.
The Driver Diagnostics Protocols provide diagnostics result messages in one or more languages. At a
minimum, the protocols should support the English language. The Driver Diagnostic Protocol advertises
the languages it supports in a data field called SupportedLanguages. This data field is a null-terminated
ASCII string that contains one or more 3 character ISO 639-2 language codes with no separator
character. The Driver Diagnostic 2 Protocol also advertises the languages it supports in a data field
called SupportedLanguages. This data filed is a null-terminated ASCII string that contains one or more
RFC 4646 language codes separated by semicolons (';').
A consumer of the Driver Diagnostics Protocols may parse the SupportedLanguages data field to
determine if the protocol supports a language in which the consumer is interested. This data field can
also be used by the implementation of the Driver Diagnostics Protocols to see if diagnostics result
messages are available in the requested language.
Example 144, below, shows the protocol interface structure for the Driver Diagnostic Protocol and the
following Example 145 shows the protocol interface structure for the Driver Diagnostics 2 Protocol for
reference. Both are composed of one service called RunDiagnostics() and a data field called
SupportedLanguages .

UEFI Drivers declare global variables for the Driver Diagnostics Protocol and Driver Diagnostics 2

The implementations of the Driver Diagnostics Protocol change in complexity depending on the type of
UEFI Driver Model driver. A device driver is the simplest to implement. A bus driver or a hybrid driver may
be more complex because it may provide diagnostics for both the bus controller and the child
controllers. These implementations are discussed later in this chapter.
The EFI
DRIVER
DIAGNOSTICS
PROTOCOL and EFI
DRIVER
DIAGNOSTICS2
_
_
_
_
_
_
PROTOCOL are installed onto the driver's image
handle. It is possible for a driver to produce more than one instance of the Driver Diagnostics Protocols.
All additional instances of the Driver Diagnostics Protocols must be installed onto new handles.
The Driver Diagnostics Protocols can either be installed directly using the UEFI Boot Service
InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces() . However, the EDK II library UefiLib provides a number of helper functions
to install the Driver Diagnostics Protocols. The helper functions that are covered in more detail in
Chapter 7 are:
EfiLibInstallAllDriverProtocols()
EfiLibInstallAllDriverProtocols2()
If an error is generated installing any of the Driver Diagnostics Protocol instances, then the entire driver
should fail and return a error status such as EFI
_
ABORTED . If a UEFI Driver implements the Unload() feature,
any Driver Diagnostics Protocol instances installed in the driver entry point must be uninstalled in the
Unload() function.
The implementation of the Driver Diagnostics Protocols for a specific driver is typically found in the file
DriverDiagnostics.c. This file contains the instances of the EFI

The RunDiagnostics() service runs diagnostics on the controller a driver is managing or a child the driver
has produced. This service is not allowed to use any of the consoleI/O-related protocols. Instead, the
results of the diagnostics are returned to the caller in a buffer. The caller may choose to log the results
or display them. The example below shows an empty implementation of the RunDiagnostics() service for
the Driver Diagnostics 2 Protocol. The recommended implementation style shown allows the same
RunDiagnostics() service implementation to be shared between the Driver Diagnostics Protocol and the
Driver Diagnostics 2 Protocol.

The DiagnosticT ype parameter tells the driver the type of diagnostics to perform. Standard diagnostics
must be implemented and test basic functionality . They should complete in less than 30 seconds.
Extended diagnostics are recommended and may take more than 30 seconds to execute.
Manufacturing diagnostics are intended to be used in manufacturing and test environments.
ErrorT ype, BufferSiz e, and Buffer are the return parameters that report the results of the diagnostic.
Buffer begins with a NULL -terminated Unicode string so the caller of the RunDiagnostics() service can
display a human-readable diagnostic result. ErrorT ype is a GUID that defines the format of the data
buffer following the NULL -terminated Unicode string. BufferSiz e is the siz e of Buffer that includes the
NULL -terminated Unicode string and the GUID-specific data buffer. The implementation of RunDiagnostics()
must allocate Buffer using the service AllocatePool() , and it is the caller's responsibility to free this buffer
with FreePool() .
The Driver Diagnostics Protocols are available only for devices a driver is currently managing. Because
UEFI supports connecting the minimum number of drivers and devices that are required to establish
console and gain access to the boot device, there may be many unconnected devices that support
diagnostics. As a result, when the user wishes to enter a platform configuration mode, the UEFI boot
manager must connect all drivers to all devices, so that the user can be shown all devices supporting
diagnostics.

13.2.1 Device Drivers
13.2.1 Device Drivers
Device drivers that implement RunDiagnostics() must verify that ChildHandle is NULL and that
ControllerHandle represents a device that the device driver is currently managing. In addition,
R unDiagnostics() must verify that the requested Language is in the set of languages that the UEFI
Driver supports. The following example shows the steps required to check these parameters. If these
checks pass, the diagnostic are executed and results are returned. In this specific example, the driver
opens the PCI I/O Protocol in its Driver Binding Start() function. This is why gEfiPciIoProtocolGuid is used in
the call to the EDK II Library UefiLib function EfiTestManagedDevice() that checks to see if the UEFI Drivers
that is providing this RunDiagnostics() service is currently managing ControllerHandle. If the private
context structure is required, typically the UEFI Boot Service OpenProtocol() is used to open one of the
UEFI Driver produced protocols on ControllerHandle and then use a CR() based macro to retrieve a
pointer to the private context structure.

T o verify the operation of the controller, diagnostic algorithms typically use the services of the protocols
the driver produces and the services of the protocols the driver consumes. For example, a PCI device
driver that consumes the PCI I/O Protocol and produces the Block I/O Protocol can use the services of
the PCI I/O Protocol to verify the operation of the PCI controller. Use the Block I/O Services to verify that
the entire driver is working as expected.

13.2.2 Bus Drivers and Hybrid Drivers
Bus drivers and hybrid drivers implementing the Driver Diagnostics Protocols must verify that
ControllerHandle and ChildHandle represent a device currently managed by the driver. In addition,
RunDiagnostics() must verify that the requested Language is in the set of languages supported by the
UEFI Driver. The following example shows the steps required to check these parameters and also
retrieve the private context data structure. If the checks pass, the diagnostics are executed and results
returned.
In this specific example, the driver opens the PCI I/O Protocol in its Driver Binding Start() function. This is
why gEfiPciIoProtocolGuid is used in the call to the EDK II Library UefiLib function EfiTestManagedDevice() . It
checks to see if the UEFI Drivers providing the RunDiagnostics() service is currently managing
ControllerHandle. If the private context structure is required, then, typically, the UEFI Boot Service
OpenProtocol() is used to open one of the protocols on ControllerHandle that the UEFI Driver produced
and then uses a CR() based macro to retrieve a pointer to the private context structure. If diagnostics
are being run on ChildHandle, a produced protocol on ChildHandle can be opened.
Note: If ChildHandle is NULL, a request is made to run diagnostics on the bus controller. If ChildHandle
is not NULL, a request is made to run diagnostics on a child controller managed by the UEFI Driver.

One useful design aspect of the Driver Diagnostics Protocol is implementation of diagnostics as a UEFI
application stored with a device (i.e. PCI Option ROM) or in an EFI System Partition. T o do so, change the
implementation of RunDiagnostics() so it does not directly execute the diagnostics. yet would perform the
same parameter checks as before and still retrieve the private context data structure. Then, instead of
executing diagnostic algorithms, use the UEFI Boot Service LoadImage() and the UEFI Boot Service
StartImage() to load and execute the UEFI application running the diagnostic algorithms. The application
then returns the results of the diagnostics back to RunDiagnostics() and RunDiagnostics() returns the final
results in the required format.

14 Driver Health Protocol
14 Driver Health Protocol
The Driver Health Protocol is a feature potentially required by UEFI Drivers following the UEFI Driver
Model. If a UEFI Driver needs to report health status to the platform, provide warning or error messages
to the user, perform length repair operations, or request that the user make hardware or software
configuration changes, the Driver Health Protocol must be produced. This protocol is required only for
devices potentially in a bad state and recoverable through either a repair operation or configuration
change. The Driver Health Protocol should not be implemented if a device can never be in a bad state
or a device can be in a bad state for which no remediation is possible.
The UEFI Boot Manager uses the services of the Driver Health Protocol, if present, to determine the
health status of a device and display that status information on a UEFI console. The UEFI Boot Manager
may also choose to perform actions to transition devices from a bad state to a usable state. See the
EFI Driver Health Protocol section of the UEFI Specification for more details on how a UEFI Boot manager
interacts with the Driver Health Protocol.
This chapter focuses on how to implement the Driver Health Protocol for a UEFI Driver managing a
specific set of devices.

14.1 Driver Health Protocol Implementation
14.1 Driver Health Protocol Implementation
The implementation of the Driver Health Protocol is typically found in the file DriverHealth.c. Appendix A
contains a template for a DriverHealth.c file for a UEFI Driver. The list of tasks to implement the Driver
Health Protocol feature follow :
Add global variable for the EFI
DRIVER
HEALTH
PROTOCOL instance to DriverHealth.c .
_
_
_
Add private fields, as required, to the design of the private context data structure that supports
storing the current health status of a device and managing repair operations.
Implement the GetHealthStatus() service of the Driver Health Protocol in DriverHealth.c .
Implement the Repair() service of the Driver Health Protocol in DriverHealth.c .
Install the Driver Health Protocol onto the same handle as that of the Driver Binding Protocol.
If the UEFI Driver produces multiple Driver Binding Protocols, install the Driver Health Protocol on the
same handles as those of the Driver Binding Protocol.
If the UEFI Driver supports the unload feature, uninstall all the Driver Health Protocol instances in
the Unload() function.
The example below shows the protocol interface structure for the Driver Health Protocol for reference
and is composed of two services; GetHealthStatus() and Repair() .

The controller is in a healthy state.
The controller requires a repair operation taking an extended period
of time to perform. The UEFI Boot Manager is required to call the
R epair() function when this state is detected.
The controller requires the user to make software or hardware
configuration changes in order to put the controller into a healthy
state. The set of software configuration changes are specified by
the FormHiiHandle parameter. The EFI Boot Manager may call the
EFI
FORM

configuration information and allow the user to make the required

The controller is in a failed state and there are no actions that can
place the controller into a healthy state. This controller, nor no any
boot devices behind it, cannot be used as a boot device.
A hardware and/or software configuration change was performed by
the user and the controller needs to be reconnected before the
controller can be placed in a healthy state. The UEFI Boot Manager
is required to call the UEFI Boot Service DisconnectController(),
followed by the UEFI Boot Service ConnectController(), to reconnect
the controller.
A hardware and/or software configuration change was performed by
the user and the controller requires the entire platform to be
rebooted before the controller can be placed in a healthy state. The
UEFI Boot Manager should complete the configuration and repair
operations on all the controllers that are not in a healthy state
before rebooting the system.
Depending on the specific health status value returned, additional information may be returned in
MessageList and FormHiiHandle as described in the table above. The health status for devices is
typically stored in the private context data structure. The Driver Binding Protocol Start() function for a
UEFI Driver is usually where the health status for a device is initially detected and the results of that
detection logic are stored in the private context data structure. As the UEFI Boot Manager performs
repair or configuration actions, the health status of a controller changes. Each time GetHealthStatus() is
called, the health status of the controller must be evaluated. The EFI Driver Health Protocol section of
the UEFI Specification defines the legal state transitions for health status values as shown in the
following figure.

Figure 18-Driver Health S tatus S tate Diagram
The Driver Health Protocol is only available for devices a driver is currently managing. Because UEFI
supports connecting the minimum number of drivers and devices required to establish console and gain
access to the boot device, there may be many unconnected devices that support The Driver Health
Protocol. As a result, when the user wishes to enter a platform configuration mode, the UEFI Boot
Manager must connect all drivers to all devices so the UEFI Boot Manager can evaluate the health
status of all the devices in the platform supporting the Driver Health Protocol.

The following example shows the steps required to check these parameters. If these checks pass, the

The Repair() service attempts repair operations on a driver-managed controller or a child the driver has
produced. This service is not allowed to use any of the console-I/Orelated protocols. Instead, the status
of the repair operation is returned to the caller. The Repair() service supports an optional parameter
called ProgressNotification that may be NULL . The caller may pass in a notification function to Repair()
so the caller can inform the user of the progress during extended repair operations. If a repair
operation takes a short period of time to execute, ProgressNotification may be ignored. If the repair
operation takes an extended period of time to execute, the UEFI Driver should periodically call the
function specified by ProgressNotification with V alue and Limit parameters expressing the amount of
repair work currently completed. The caller may choose to log or display the progress of the repair
operation as well as the final results of the repair operation.

14.3.2 Bus Drivers and Hybrid Drivers
Bus drivers and hybrid drivers that implement the Driver Health Protocol must verify that
ControllerHandle and ChildHandle represent a device that the driver is currently managing. The example
below shows the steps required to check these parameters and also retrieve the private context data
structure. If these checks pass, the health status is returned. In this specific example, the driver opens
the PCI I/O Protocol in its Driver Binding Start() function.
This is why gEfiPciIoProtocolGuid is used in the call to the EDK II Library UefiLib function EfiTestManagedDevice()
that checks to see if the UEFI Drivers providing this Repair() service are currently managing
ControllerHandle. If the private context structure is required, typically the UEFI Boot Service OpenProtocol()
is used to open one of the UEFI Driver produced protocols on ControllerHandle and then uses a CR()
based macro to retrieve a pointer to the private context structure.
If diagnostics are being run on ChildHandle, a produced protocol on ChildHandle can be opened. This
example also calls ProgressNotification from 10% to 100% at 10% increments for the bus controller and
from 1% to 100%, at 1% increments, for the child controller.
Note: If ChildHandle is NULL, a request is made to run diagnostics on the bus controller. If ChildHandle
is not NULL, a request is made to run diagnostics on a UEFI Driver managed child controller.

15 Driver Family Override Protocol
15 Driver Family Override Protocol
The Driver Family Override Protocol is an optional feature for UEFI Drivers following the UEFI Driver Model.
The Driver Family Override Protocol provides a method for a UEFI Driver to opt-in to a higher priority rule
for connecting drivers to controllers in the EFI Boot Service ConnectController() . This rule is higher priority
than the Bus Specific Driver Override Protocol rule and lower priority than the Platform Driver Override
R ule.
The Driver Family Override Protocol is typically produced by UEFI Drivers associated with a family of
similar controllers when multiple versions of a UEFI Driver for a family of similar controllers are present in
a platform at the same time and where the UEFI Driver writer requires that the UEFI Driver considered
the highest version manage all controllers in that same family .
PCI Use Case: If a platform has 3 PCI SCSI adapters from the same manufacturer, and the
manufacturer requires the PCI SCSI adapter that has the highest version UEFI Driver to manage all 3 PCI
SCSI adapters, then the Driver Family Override Protocol is required and it provides the version value
used to make the selection. If the Driver Family Override Protocol is not produced, then the Bus Specific
Driver Override Protocol for PCI selects the UEFI Driver from the PCI Option ROM to the adapter to
manage each adapter.

Implement the GetVersion() service of the Driver Family Override Protocol in DriverFamilyOverride.c .
Install the Driver Family Override Protocol onto the same handle that the Driver Binding Protocol is
installed.
If the UEFI Driver produces multiple Driver Binding Protocols, install the Driver Family Override
Protocol on the same handles as that of the Driver Binding Protocol.
If the UEFI Driver supports the unload feature, uninstall all the Driver Family Override Protocol
instances in the Unload() function.
The Driver Family Override Protocol contains one service called GetVersion() that returns version value
used by the UEFI Boot Service ConnectController() to determine the order of Driver Binding Protocol used
to start a specific controller. If the Driver Family Override Protocol is present, it is higher priority than the
Bus Specific Driver Override Protocol, but lower than the Platform Driver Override Protocol. See the
Chapter 3 and the Protocol Handler Services section of the UEFI Specification for details on how the
UEFI Boot Service ConnectController() selects the best UEFI Driver to manage a specific controller.
For reference, the example below shows the protocol interface structure for the Driver Family Override
Protocol. It is composed of a single service called GetVersion() .

17 Bus-Specific Driver Override Protocol
17 Bus-Specific Driver Override Protocol
Some bus drivers are required to produce the Bus Specific Driver Override Protocol. The driver model for
a specific bus type must declare if this protocol is required or not. In general, this protocol applies only
to bus types that provide containers for UEFI Drivers on their child devices.
At this time, the only bus type that is required to produce this protocol is PCI, and the container for
drivers is the PCI option ROM. The PCI bus driver is required to produce the Bus Specific Driver Override
Protocol for PCI devices that have an attached PCI option ROM if the PCI option ROM contains one or
more loadable UEFI drivers. If a PCI option ROM is not present, or the PCI option ROM does not contain
any loadable UEFI drivers, a Bus Specific Driver Override Protocol is not produced for that PCI device.

structure.
Implement the GetDriver() service to return set-of -driver image handles from the private context data
Implement private worker functions to add/remove driver image handles from set-of -driver image
handles maintained in the private context data structure.
Install the Bus Specific Driver Override Protocol onto the child handle the bus driver produces in the
Driver Binding Start() function.
Uninstall the Bus Specific Driver Override Protocol from the child handle the bus driver produces in
the Driver Binding Stop() function.
The Bus Specific Driver Override Protocol contains one service called GetDriver() that returns an ordered
list of driver image handles for the UEFI drivers that were loaded from a container of UEFI driver(s).
There are many ways to implement storage for the ordered list of driver image handled including an
array and linked lists.
PCI Use Case : The order in which the image handles are returned by the PCI Bus Driver matches the order
in which the UEFI drivers were found in the PCI option ROM, from the lowest address to the highest
address. The PCI bus driver is responsible for enumerating the PCI devices on a PCI bus. When a PCI
device is discovered, the PCI device is also checked to see if it has an attached PCI option ROM. The PCI
option ROM contents must follow the PCI Specification for storing one or more images. The PCI bus
driver walks the list of images in a PCI option ROM looking for UEFI drivers. If a UEFI driver is found, it is
optionally decompressed using the Decompress Protocol and then loaded The driver entry point is
called using the UEFI boot services LoadImage() and StartImage() . If LoadImage() does not return an error,
the UEFI driver must be added to the end of the list of drivers the Bus Specific Driver Override Protocol
for that PCI device returns after the GetDriver() service is called.

17.5 Adding Driver Image Handles
17.5 Adding Driver Image Handles
The example below shows an internal worker function that adds a driver image handle to the ordered
list of driver image handles in the private context data structure. This function is used by the bus driver
to register image handles associated with UEFI Drivers discovered on child devices (i.e. when the PCI
bus driver discovered UEFI Drivers stored in PCI option ROMs). As each UEFI driver is loaded, this internal
worker function is called to add the image handle of the UEFI driver to the Bus Specific Driver Override
Protocol. The order that the image handles are registered with AbcAddDriver() is the order in which they
are returned from GetDriver() .
If there is not enough room in the image handle array, an array with 10 additional handles is allocated.
The contents of the old array are transferred to the new array and the old array is freed. The EDK II
library MemoryAllocationLib provides the ReallocatePool() function, simplifying the implementations of UEFI
Drivers required to manage dynamic memory . Lacking enough memory to allocate the new array, the
EFI
OUT
OF
_
_
_
RESOURCES is returned. Once there is enough room to store the new image handle, the image
handle is added to the end of the array and EFI
SUCCESS is returned.

There are several categories of PCI drivers that cooperate to provide support for PCI controllers in a
platform. T able 25- lists these PCI drivers.
Table 25-Classes of PCI drivers

Description
Produces one or more instances of the PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol.
PCI bus
driver
Consumes the PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol, produces a child handle for each PCI
controller, and installs the Device Path Protocol and the PCI I/O Protocol onto each
child handle.
PCI
driver
Consumes the PCI I/O Protocol and produces an I/O abstraction providing services for
the console and boot devices required to boot an EFI-conformant operating system.
This chapter concentrates on the design and implementation of PCI drivers. PCI drivers must follow all of
the general design guidelines described in Chapter 4. This chapter covers guidelines that apply
specifically to the management of PCI controllers.
The following figure shows an example PCI driver stack and the protocols the PCIrelated drivers
consume and produce. In this example, the platform hardware produces a single PCI root bridge. The
PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol driver accesses the hardware resources to produce a single handle with the
EFI
DEVICE
PATH
PROTOCOL and the EFI
PCI
ROOT
BRIDGE
IO
PROTOCOL .
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
The PCI bus driver consumes the services of the PCI
ROOT
BRIDGE
IO
PROTOCOL and uses those services to
_
_
_
_
enumerate the PCI controllers present in the system. In this example, the PCI bus driver detected a disk
controller, a graphics controller, and a USB host controller. As a result, the PCI bus driver produces
three child handles with the EFI
DEVICE
PATH
PROTOCOL and the EFI
PCI
IO
_
_
_
_
_
_
PROTOCOL .
The driver for the PCI disk controller consumes the services of the EFI
PCI
IO
_
_
_
PROTOCOL and produces
two child handles with the EFI
DEVICE
PATH
PROTOCOL and the EFI
BLOCK
IO
_
_
_
_
_
_
PROTOCOL .
The PCI driver for the graphics controller consumes the services of the EFI
PCI
IO
_
_
_
PROTOCOL and
produces a child handle with the EFI
GRAPHICS
OUTPUT
_
_
_
PROTOCOL .
The PCI driver for the USB host controller consumes the services of the EFI
PCI
IO
_
_
_
PROTOCOL to produce
the EFI
USB
HOST
CONTROLLER
_
_
_
_
PROTOCOL . Although not shown in Figure 19, the EFI
USB
HOST
CONTROLLER
_
_
_
_
PROTOCOL
would then be consumed by the USB bus driver to produce child handles for each USB device. USB
drivers would then manage those child handles.
Chapter 19 contains the guidelines for designing USB drivers.

18.1 PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol Drivers
18.1 PCI Root Bridge I/O Protocol Drivers
UEFI firmware for a platform typically implements a R oot Bridge Driver that produces the PCI R oot Bridge
I/O Protocol. This code is chipset specific and directly accesses the chipset resources producing the
services of the PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol. A sample driver for systems with a PC-A T -compatible chipset
is included in EDK II. The source code for this driver is found in the EDK II package called PcAtChipsetPkg in
the directory PcAtChipsetPkg/PciHostBridgeDxe .

18.2 PCI Bus Drivers
18.2 PCI Bus Drivers
EDK II contains a generic PCI bus driver. It uses the services of the EFI
PCI
ROOT
BRIDGE
IO
_
_
_
_
_
PROTOCOL to
enumerate PCI devices and produce a child handle with an EFI
DEVICE
PATH
_
_
_
PROTOCOL and an
EFI
PCI
IO
_
_
_
PROTOCOL . The source code to this driver is in the EDK II package called MdeModulePkg in the
directory MdeModulePkg/Bus/Pci/PciBusDxe .
This bus type can support producing one child handle at a time by parsing the R emainingDevicePath in
its Supported() and Start() services. However, producing one child handle at a time for a PCI bus
generally does not make sense. This is because the PCI bus driver needs to enumerate and assign
resources to all of the PCI devices before even a single child handle can be produced.
It does not take much extra time to produce the child handles for all the enumerated PCI devices.
Because of this, it is recommended that the PCI bus driver produce all of the PCI devices on the first call
to Start() .
If a UEFI based system firmware is ported to a new platform, most of the PCI-related changes occur in
the implementation of the R oot Bridge Driver producing the EFI
PCI
ROOT
BRIDGE
IO
_
_
_
_
_

TIP: PCI Bus Driver customiz ations are strongly discouraged because the PCI Bus Driver is designed
to be conformant with the PCI Specification. Instead, focus platform specific customiz ations on the R oot
Bridge Driver that produced EFI
PCI

18.2.1 Hot-plug PCI buses
The PCI bus driver in the EDK II does not support hot-plug events in the pre-boot environment. The PCI
bus driver functions correctly with hot-plug-capable hardware, but the hot-add, hot-remove, and hot-
replace events are only supported while an OS that supports hot-plug events is executing. The PCI bus

18.3.1 Supported()
18.3.1 Supported()
A PCI driver must implement the EFI
DRIVER
BINDING
_
_
_
PROTOCOL containing the Supported() , Start() , and Stop()
services. The Supported() service evaluates the ControllerHandle passed in to see if the ControllerHandle
represents a PCI device the PCI driver can manage.
The most common method of implementing the test is for the PCI driver to retrieve the PCI configuration
header from the PCI controller and evaluate the device ID, vendor ID, and, possibly, the class code fields
of the PCI configuration header. If these fields match the values the PCI driver knows how to manage,
Supported() returns
EFI
_
SUCCESS . Otherwise, the Supported() service returns EFI
UNSUPPORTED . The PCI driver must be careful not
_
to disturb the state of the PCI controller because a different PCI driver may be managing the PCI
controller.
Caution: Do not allow functions to "touch" or change the state of any hardware device in the
Supported() function of the Driver Binding Protocol. Doing so can significantly degrade the driver's
performance and/or cause the device, the driver, and/or other drivers to lose sync and behave badly
and unpredictably .
TIP: When modifying PCI device registers, be careful with the bits in the PCI device configuration space.
Perform a read, then modify the desired bits, then do a write. Do not perform only a write operation to
the bits, since that can reset other bits in the register.
The following example shows an example of the Driver Binding Protocol Supported() service for the ABC
PCI driver managing a PCI controller with a vendor ID of 0x8086 and a device ID of 0xFFFE.
First, it attempts to open the PCI I/O Protocol EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL
BY
_
_
_
_
DRIVER with OpenProtocol() . If the PCI I/O
Protocol cannot be opened, the PCI driver does not support the controller specified by
ControllerHandle. If the PCI I/O Protocol is opened, the services of the PCI I/O Protocol are used to read
the vendor ID and device ID from the PCI configuration header. Always closed the PCI I/O Protocol with
CloseProtocol(). EFI
SUCCESS is returned if the vendor ID and device ID match.

The previous example performs two 16-bit reads from the PCI configuration header.
The code would be smaller if the entire PCI configuration header were read at once. However, this would
increase the execution time because the Supported() service reads the entire PCI configuration header
for every ControllerHandle passed in.

18.3.2 Start() and Stop()
18.3.2 Start() and Stop()
The Start() service of the Driver Binding Protocol for a PCI driver also opens the PCI I/O Protocol with an
attribute of EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL
BY
_
_
_
_
DRIVER . If the PCI driver is a bus or hybrid driver, the Device Path Protocol
opens using the attribute EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL
BY
_
_
_
_
DRIVER . A device driver is not required to open the Device
Path Protocol. In addition, all PCI drivers are required to call the Attributes() service of the PCI I/O
Protocol to enable the I/O, memory, and bus master bits in the Command register of the PCI
configuration header. By default, the PCI bus driver is not required to enable the Command register of
the PCI controllers. Instead, it is the responsibility of the Start() service to enable these bits and that of
the Stop() service to restore these bits. In order for the Stop() service to restore the attributes, a PCI
Driver typically stores the original attributes in a UINT64 field of the private context data structure.
There is one additional attribute that must be specified in this call to the Attributes() service. If the PCI
controller is a bus master and capable of generating 64-bit DMA addresses, the
EFI
PCI
IO
ATTRIBUTE
DUAL
ADDRESS
_
_
_
_
_
_
CYCLE attribute must also be enabled. Unfortunately, there is no standard
method for detecting if a PCI controller supports 32-bit or 64-bit DMA addresses. As a result, it is the PCI
driver's responsibility to inform the PCI bus driver that the PCI controller is capable of producing 64-bit
DMA addresses.
The PCI bus driver assumes that all PCI controllers are only capable of generating 32-bit DMA addresses
unless the PCI driver enables the dual address cycle attribute.
The PCI bus driver uses this information along with the services of the PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol to
perform PCI DMA transactions. If a PCI bus master that is capable of 32-bit DMA addresses is present in
a platform supporting more than 4 GB of system memory, the DMA transactions may have to be double
buffered. Double buffering can reduce the performance of a driver. It is also possible for some platforms
to only support system memory above 4 GB. For these reasons, a PCI driver must always accurately
describe the DMA capabilities of the PCI controller from the Start() service of the Driver Binding
Protocol.
The example below shows the code fragment from the Start() services of a PCI driver for a PCI controller
supporting 64-bit DMA transactions. The example opens the PCI I/O Protocol attribute of
EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL
BY
_
_
_
_
DRIVER . It then retrieves the current set of PCI I/O Protocol attributes and saves them in
the private context data structure field called ABC
PRIVATE
DATA . It then determines what attribute the PCI
_
_
I/O Protocol supports and enables the I/O decode, MMIO decode, and Bus Master, and Dual Address
Cycle capabilities. If a PCI Controller does not support DAC, the only change is the removal of
EFI
PCI

ATTRIBUTE
DUAL

CYCLE from the last call to the Attributes() service of the PCI I/O Protocol.

determine if a specific PCI Controller and its associated PCI Option ROM image are from a PCI add-in card
in a PCI slot or if they are integrated into a platform. The attributes shown in the following table list the
# define statements for these attributes. These attributes are read-only and the values are established
by the PCI Bus Driver when a PCI Controller is discovered and the PCI I/O Protocol is produced. A PCI
driver may retrieve the attributes of a PCI controller with the Attributes() service of the PCI I/O Protocol,
but a PCI Driver is not allowed to modify these attributes.

18.3.3 PCI Cards with Multiple PCI Controllers
18.3.3 PCI Cards with Multiple PCI Controllers
Some PCI devices have a series of identical devices on a single device, normally behind a PCI bridge.
These devices may require additional work if they need to be controlled by a single instance of the UEFI
driver. T ake the following figure as a sample device.
Figure 20-A multi-controller PCI device
It may be required that the driver in the Option ROM control all 3 controllers on the PCI device. T o do
this, use the following actions:
In the Supported() function, make sure that the UEFI Driver supports the controller that is passed into
the Support() function. The first controller passed in could be any of the controllers on a PCI Card.
In the Supported() function, make sure the function does not touch or change the HW state. This is
very important. If the PCI I/O instance is already opened (if some other application or driver is
already managing the controller), return an error. See Chapter 9 of this guide and the EFI Driver
Binding Protocol section of the UEFI Specification for details on the error return codes from the
Driver Binding Protocol Supported() function.
In the Start() function for the first controller on the PCI Card, open the PCI I/O protocol instances on
the other handles on the same PCI Card using the EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL
BY
DRIVER attribute. This informs all
_
_
_
_
other UEFI Drivers in the platform that all the controllers on the PCI Card are already being
managed. T o scan for other PCI controllers on the same PCI Card, use the UEFI Boot Service
LocateHandleBuffer() to find all handles in the Handle Database supporting the PCI I/O Protocol. Use
the PCI I/O Protocol function GetLocation()to evaluate whether or not the PCI controller is on the
same PCI bus number. T ake care to not modify the HW state of any PCI I/O Protocol instance during
this evaluation.
In the Stop() function, undo everything that was done in Start() . Use a private context data
structure to keep track of the information required to complete a Stop() operation in these more
complex use cases.

18.4 Accessing PCI resources
18.4 Accessing PCI resources
PCI drivers should only access the I/O and memory-mapped I/O resources on the PCI controllers they
manage. They should never attempt to access the I/O or memorymapped I/O resource of a PCI controller
that they are not managing. They should also never touch the I/O or memory-mapped I/O resources of
the chipset or the motherboard.
The PCI I/O Protocol provides services that allow a PCI driver to easily access the resources of the PCI
controllers it is currently managing. These services hide platformspecific implementation details and
prevent a PCI driver from inadvertently accessing resources of the motherboard or other PCI controllers.
The PCI I/O Protocol has also been designed to simplify the implementation of PCI drivers. For example, a
PCI driver should never read the BARs in the PCI configuration header. Instead, the PCI driver passes in
a BarIndex and Offset into the PCI I/O Protocol services. The PCI bus driver is responsible for managing
the PCI controller's BARs.
The services of the PCI I/O Protocol allowing a PCI driver to access the resources of a PCI controller
include the following:
PciIo->PollMem()
PciIo->PollIo()
PciIo->Mem.Read()
PciIo->Mem.Write()
PciIo->Io.Read()
PciIo->Io.Write()
PciIo->Pci.Read()
PciIo->Pci.Write()
PciIo->CopyMem()
Another important resource provided through the PCI I/O Protocol is the contents of the PCI option ROM.
The R omSiz e and R omImage fields of the PCI I/O Protocol provide access to a copy of the PCI option ROM
contents. These fields may be useful if the PCI driver requires additional information from the contents
of the PCI option ROM.
Note: It is important that the PCI option ROM contents not be modified through the R omImage field.
Modifications to this buffer only modify the copy of the PCI option ROM contents in system memory . The
PCI I/O Protocol does not provide services to modify the content of the actual PCI option ROM.

18.4.1 Memory-mapped I/O ordering issues
18.4.1 Memory-mapped I/O ordering issues
PCI transactions follow the ordering rules defined in the PCI Specification. The ordering rules vary for I/O,
memory-mapped I/O, and PCI configuration cycles.
The PCI I/O Protocol Mem.Read() service generates PCI memory read cycles guaranteed to complete
before control is returned to the PCI driver. However, the PCI I/O Protocol Mem.Write() service does not
guarantee that PCI memory cycles produced by this service are completed before control is returned to
the PCI driver. This distinction means that memory write transactions may be sitting in write buffers
when this service returns. If the PCI driver requires a Mem.Write() transaction to complete, then the
Mem.Write() transaction must be followed by a Mem.Read() transaction to the same PCI controller. Some
chipsets and PCI-to-PCI bridges are more sensitive to this issue than others.
The following example shows a Mem.Write() call to a memory-mapped I/O register at offset 0x20 into BAR
# 1 of a PCI controller. This write transaction is followed by a Mem.Read() call from the same memory-
mapped I/O register. This combination guarantees that the write transaction is completed by the time
the Mem.Read() call returns.
In general, this mechanism is not required because a PCI driver typically reads a status register and this
read transaction forces all posted write transactions to complete on the PCI controller. The only time to
use this mechanism is when a PCI driver performs a write transaction not immediately followed by a read
transaction and the PCI driver needs to guarantee that the write transaction is completed immediately .

18.4.2 Hardfail/Softfail
PCI drivers must make sure they do not access resources not allocated to any PCI controllers. Doing so
may produce unpredictable results including platform hang conditions.
For example, if a VGA device is in monochrome mode, accessing the VGA device's color registers may
cause unpredictable results. The best rule of thumb here is to access only I/O or memory-mapped I/O
resources to which the PCI driver knows, for sure, that the PCI controller does respond. In general, this
is not a concern because the PCI I/O Protocol services do not allow the PCI driver to access resources
outside the resource ranges described in the BARs of the PCI controllers. However, two mechanisms
allow a PCI driver to bypass these safeguards.
The first is to use the EFI
PCI
IO
PASS

_
_
_
_
_

I/O and memory-mapped I/O regions.
The second is for a PCI driver to retrieve and use the services of a PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol.
A PCI driver uses the EFI
PCI
IO
PASS

BAR to access ISA resources on a PCI controller. For a PCI driver
_
_
_
_
_
to use this mechanism safely, the PCI driver must know that the desired PCI controller does respond to
the I/O or memory-mapped I/O requests in the ISA ranges. The PCI driver can typically know if it responds
by examining the class code, vendor ID, and device ID fields of the PCI controller in the PCI configuration
header. The PCI driver must examine the PCI configuration header before any I/O or memory-mapped I/O
operations are generated. The PCI configuration header is typically examined in the Supported() service,
so it is safe to access the ISA resources in the Start() service and in the services of the I/O abstraction
that the PCI driver is producing. The following is an example using the EFI

A PCI driver must also take care when using the services of the PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol. It can
retrieve the parent PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol and use those services to touch any resource on the PCI
bus.
Caution: This touching of resources on the PCI bus can be very dangerous because the PCI driver may
not know if a different PCI driver owns a resource or not. The use of this mechanism is strongly
discouraged and is best left to OEM drivers having intimate knowledge of the platform and chipset.
Chapter 5 discusses the use of the LocateDevicePath() service and the example associated with this
service shows how the parent PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol can be retrieved.
Instead of using the parent PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol, PCI drivers needing access to the resources of
other PCI controllers in the platform should search the Handle Database for controller handles
supporting the PCI I/O Protocol. T o prevent resource conflicts, open PCI I/O Protocols from other PCI
controllers with EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL

DRIVER .
_
_
_
_
The following example shows how a PCI driver can easily retrieve the list of PCI controller handles in the
Handle Database and use the services of the PCI I/O Protocol on each of those handles to find peer PCI
controllers.
For example, a PCI adapter containing multiple PCI controllers behind a PCI-to-PCI bridge may use a
single driver to manage all of the controllers on the adapter. When the PCI driver is connected to the
first PCI controller on the adapter, the PCI driver connects to all the other PCI controllers having the
same bus number as the first. This example takes advantage of the GetLocation() service of the PCI I/O
Protocol to find matching bus numbers.

18.4.3 When a PCI device does not receive resources
18.4.3 When a PCI device does not receive resources
Some PCI controllers may require more resources than the PCI bus can offer. In such cases, the PCI
controller must not be visible to PCI drivers because resources were not allocated to the PCI controller.
The PCI bus driver does not create a child handle for a PCI controller that does not have any allocated
resources, and as a result, a PCI driver is never be passed a ControllerHandle for a PCI controller not
having allocated resources.
The platform vendor controls the policy decisions that are made when this type of resource-constrained
condition is encountered. The PCI driver writer never has to handle this case.

18.5.1 Map() Service Cautions
18.5.1 Map() Service Cautions
A common mistake in writing PCI drivers is omission of the use of the Map() service. On platforms with
coherent PCI busses having a 1:1 mapping between CPU addresses and PCI DMA addresses, such as
PCI implementations on many IA32, X 64, and IPF systems, the omission of Map() may not produce any
functional issues. However, if those same UEFI Driver sources are used on a platform is that not
coherent, nor guarantees a 1:1 mapping between CPU addresses and PCI DMA addresses, the UEFI
Driver may not function correctly, with the likely result being data corruption. For this reason, Map()
must always be used when setting up a PCI DMA transfer.
TIP: Although omission of the Map() service may work on some platforms, use of Map() for DMA
transaction is required and maximiz es UEFI Driver compatibility .
The Map() service converts a system memory address to an address useful to a PCI device performing
bus master DMA transactions. The device address returned is not related to the original system memory
address. Some chipsets maintain a one-to-one mapping between system memory addresses and device
addresses on the PCI bus. For this special case, the system memory address and device address are
the same. However, a PCI driver cannot tell if it is executing on a platform with this one-to-one mapping.
As a result, a PCI driver must make as few assumptions about the system architecture as possible.
A voiding assumptions means that a PCI driver must never use the device address that is returned from
Map() to access the contents of the DMA buffer. Instead, this value should only be used to program the
base address of the DMA transaction into the PCI controller. This programming is typically accomplished
with one or more I/O or memory-mapped I/O write transactions to the PCI controller the PCI driver is
managing.
The example below shows the function prototype for the Map() service of the PCI I/O Protocol. A PCI
driver can use HostAddress to access the contents of the DMA buffer, but must never use the returned
parameter DeviceAddress to access the contents of the DMA buffer.

Some processors, such as those in IPF platforms, have weakly ordered memory models. With weak
ordering, system memory transactions may complete in a different order than the source code would
seem to indicate. A PCI driver should be implemented so that the source code is compatible with as
many processors and platforms as possible. As a result, the guidelines on the use of the EDK II library
BaseLib function MemoryFence() (see the next discussion) should be followed even if the driver is not initially
implemented for an IPF platform. The techniques shown here do not have any impact on the executable

18.5.3 Bus Master R ead and W rite Operations
18.5.3 Bus Master Read and Write Operations
When a DMA transaction starts or stops, the ownership of the DMA buffer transitions from the
processor to the DMA bus master and back to the processor. The PCI I/O Protocol provides the Map()
and Unmap() services used to set up and complete a DMA transaction.
The implementation of the PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol uses the EDK II library BaseLib function
MemoryFence() to guarantee all system memory transactions from the processor are completed before the
DMA transaction is started. This prevents a DMA bus master reading from a location in the DMA buffer
before a write transaction is flushed from the processor. Because this functionality is built into the PCI
R oot Bridge I/O Protocol itself, the PCI driver writer need not worry about bus master read/ write
operations.
A PCI driver is responsible for flushing all posted write data from a PCI controller when a bus master
write operation is completed. First, the PCI driver should read from a register on the PCI controller to
guarantee that all posted write operations are flushed from the PCI controller and through any PCI-to-
PCI bridges between the PCI controller and the PCI root bridge.
Because PCI drivers are polled, they typically read from a status register on the PCI controller to
determine when the bus master write transaction is completed. This read operation is usually sufficient
to flush the posted write buffers. The PCI driver must also call the PciIo->Flush() service at the end of a
bus master write operation. This service flushes all the posted write buffers in the system chipset and
guarantees their commitment to system memory . The combination of the read operation and the
PciIo>Flush() call guarantee that the bus master's view of system memory and the processor's view of
system memory are consistent.
An example of how a bus master write transaction should be completed to guarantee the bus master's
view of system memory is consistent with that of the processor follows.

18.5.4 Bus Master Common Buffer Operations
18.5.4 Bus Master Common Buffer Operations
Bus master common buffer operations are more complex to manage than bus master read and write
operations. because both the bus master and the processor may simultaneously access a single region
of system memory . The memory ordering of PCI transactions generated by the PCI bus master is defined
in the PCI Specification. However, different processors may use different memory ordering models. As a
result, common buffer operations should only be used when they are absolutely required.
If the common buffer memory region can be accessed in a single atomic processor transaction, no
haz ards are present. If the processor has deep write buffers, a write transaction may be delayed. The
EDK II library BaseLib provides the MemoryFence() function to force completion of all processor transactions.
If a memory region to which the processor needs to read or write requires multiple atomic processor
transactions, haz ards may exist if the operations are reordered. If the order in which the processor
transactions occur is important, insert the MemoryFence() between the processor transactions. Use
sparingly, though. Inserting too many MemoryFence() calls may degrade system performance. For strongly
ordered processors, the MemoryFence() function is a no-op.
A good example of MemoryFence() use is that of a mailbox data structure used to communicate between
the processor and a bus master. The mailbox typically contains a valid bit that must be set by the
processor after the processor has filled the contents of the mailbox. The bus master scans the mailbox
to see if the valid bit is set. When the bus master sees the valid bit is set, it reads the rest of the
mailbox contents and uses them to perform an I/O operation. If the processor is weakly ordered, there
is a chance that the valid bit is set before the processor has written all of the other fields in the data
structure. T o resolve this issue, a MemoryFence() call is inserted just before and just after the valid bit is
set.
Another mechanism used to resolve these memory-ordering issues is that of the volatile keyword in C
sources. If the data structure used as a mailbox is declared in C as volatile , the C compiler guarantees
that all transactions to the volatile data structure are strongly ordered. It is recommended that the
MemoryFence() call be used instead of volatile data structures.
18.5.5 GB Memory Boundary
32-bit platforms may support more than 4 GB of system memory, but UEFI drivers for 32-bit platforms
may only access memory below 4 GB. The 4 GB memory boundary becomes more complex on 64-bit
platforms. Also, some 64-bit platforms may not map any system memory in the memory region below 4
GB. For more information about the 4 GB memory boundary on various architectures, see Section 4.2 of
this guide.
A UEFI driver should not allocate buffers from, or below, specific addresses. These types of allocations
may fail on different system architectures. Likewise, the buffers used for DMA should not be allocated
from, or below, a specific address. Also, UEFI drivers should always use the services of the PCI I/O
Protocol to set up and complete DMA transactions.
Caution: It is not legal to program a system memory address into a DMA bus master. Such
programming may function correctly on platforms having a one-to-one mapping between system memory
addresses and PCI DMA addresses, but it will not work on platforms that remap DMA transactions, nor
on platforms using a virtual addressing mode for system memory addresses not one-to-one mapped to
the PCI DMA addresses.

18.5.4 Bus Master Common Buffer Operations
The following sections contain code examples for the different types of PCI DMA transactions supported
by the UEFI Specification. It shows how to best use the PCI I/O Protocol services to maximiz e the platform
compatibility of UEFI drivers.
EDK II contains an implementation of the PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol for a PC-A T compatible chipset, and
assumes a one-to-one mapping between system memory and PCI DMA addresses. It also assumes that
DMA operations are not supported above 4 GB. The implementation of the Map() and Unmap() services in
the PCI R oot Bridge I/O Protocol handle DMA requests above 4 GB by allocating a buffer below 4 GB and
copying the data to that buffer below 4 GB.
Note: It is important to realiz e that these functions are implemented differently for platforms not
assuming a one-to-one mapping between system memory addresses and PCI DMA addresses or if the
platform can only perform DMA in specific ranges of system memory .

18.5.6 DMA Bus Master R ead Operation
18.5.6 DMA Bus Master Read Operation
The general algorithm for performing a bus master read operation is as follows:
The processor initializ es the contents of the DMA using HostAddress.
Call Map() with an Operation of EfiPciOperationBusMasterRead .
Program the DMA bus master with the DeviceAddress returned by Map() .
Program the DMA bus master with the NumberOfBytes returned by Map() .
Start the DMA bus master.
W ait for DMA bus master to complete the bus master read operation.
Call Unmap() .
The following example shows a function for performing a bus master read operation on a PCI controller.
The PCI controller is accessed through the parameter PciIo. The system memory buffer read by the bus
master is specified by HostAddress and Length. This function performs one or more bus master read
operations until either Length bytes have been read by the bus master or an error is detected. The PCI
controller in this example has three MMIO registers in BAR #1 The MMIO register at offset 0x10 is a
status register the function uses to check if the DMA operation is complete or not. The function writes
the start of the DMA transaction to the MMIO register at offset 0x20 and the length of the DMA
transaction to the MMIO register at offset 0x24 The write operation to offset 0x24 also starts the DMA
read operation. The services of the PCI I/O Protocol used in this example include Map() , Unmap() ,
Mem.Write() , and PollMem() . The example below is for a 32-bit PCI bus master.
A 64-bit PCI bus master instance uses two 32-bit MMIO registers to specify the start address and two
32-bit MMIO registers to specify the length. If the PCI bus master supports 64-bit DMA addressing, the

18.5.8 DMA Bus Master Common Buffer Operation
18.5.8 DMA Bus Master Common Buffer Operation
A PCI driver uses common buffers when a memory region requires simultaneous access by both the
processor and a PCI bus master. A common buffer is typically allocated in the Start() service and freed
in the Stop() service. This mechanism is very different from the bus master read and bus master write
operations where the PCI driver transfers the ownership of a memory region from the processor to the
bus master and back to the processor.
The general algorithm for allocating a common buffer in the Start() follows:
Call AllocateBuffer() to allocate a common buffer.
Call Map() with an Operation of EfiPciOperationBusMasterCommonBuffer .
Program the DMA bus master with the DeviceAddress returned by Map() .
The common buffer can now be accessed equally by the processor (using HostAddress) and the
DMA bus master (using DeviceAddress) .
The general algorithm for freeing a common buffer in the Stop() service is as follows:
Call Unmap() .
* Call FreeBuffer() .
The example below shows an example function the Start() service calls to set up a common buffer
operation for a specific PCI controller. The function accesses the PCI controller through the PciIo
parameter. The function allocates a common buffer of Length bytes and returns the address of the
common buffer in HostAddress.
A mapping is created for the common buffer and returned in the parameter Mapping. The MMIO register
at offset 0x18 of BAR #1 is the start address of the common buffer from the PCI controller's perspective.
The services of the PCI I/O Protocol used in this example include AllocateBuffer() , Map() , and Mem.Write() .
This example is for a 32-bit PCI bus master. A 64-bit PCI bus master requires two 32-bit MMIO registers to
specify the start address, and the EFI

18.6.2 PCI I/O FIFO operations
18.6.2 PCI I/O FIFO operations
The examples below show an example of writing a sector to an IDE controller. The IDE controller uses a
single 16-bit I/O port as a FIFO for reading and writing sector data. The first example calls the PCI I/O
Protocol 256 times to write the sector. The second example calls the PCI I/O Protocol once to perform
the same operation, providing better performance if compiled with an EBC compiler. This example
applies equally to FIFO read operations.

18.6.3 PCI I/O CopyMem() Operations
18.6.3 PCI I/O CopyMem() Operations
The following examples show how scrolling a frame buffer by different methods can provide performance
improvements. In the first, the scroll operation is performed using a loop to move one scan line at a
time. The PCI I/O Protocol CopyMem() service is similar to the UEFI Boot Service CopyMem() , except the PCI I/O
Protocol operates on PCI MMIO ranges described by PCI MMIO BARs.
In general, the PCI I/O Protocol should be used, whenever possible, to eliminate loops in the UEFI Driver.
This example assumes a 1 MB frame buffer MMIO, accessed through BAR #0 of the PCI graphics
controller, with a screen 800 pixels wide, and 32 bits per pixel.
In the second example, the scroll operation is performed using a single PCI I/O Protocol call to CopyMem()
to produce the exact same result. The second example executes significantly faster if the UEFI Driver is
compiled with an EBC compiler because the loop has been removed from the UEFI Driver.

18.6.5 PCI I/O MMIO Buffer Operations
The following examples demonstrate how writing to a PCI memory-mapped I/O buffer can dramatically
affect the performance of a UEFI Driver. In the first example, a loop is used with 8-bit operations. In the
second, the same operation is done with a single call. This example is based on writing to a 1MB frame
buffer by a UEFI Driver for a graphics controller.
Note: The examples shown here apply equally well to reading a bitmap from the frame buffer of a PCI

18.6.6 PCI I/O Polling Operations
18.6.6 PCI I/O Polling Operations
These same types of optimiz ation can be applied to polling as well. In the following examples, two
different polling methods are shown:
A loop with 10 μs stalls to wait up to 1 minute
A single call to PCI I/O protocol to perform the entire operation
These types of polling operations are usually performed when a driver is waiting for the hardware to
complete an operation with the completion status indicated by a bit changing state in an I/O port or a
memory-mapped I/O port. The examples below poll offset 0x20 in BAR #1 for bit 0 to change from 0 to 1.
The PollIo() and PollMem() functions in the PCI I/O Protocol are very flexible and can simplify the
operation of polling for bits to change state in status registers.

18.7 PCI Option ROM Images
18.7 PCI Option ROM Images
The EDK II provides tools to aide in the development of UEFI drivers for PCI adapters. Once UEFI Driver(s)
for a PCI adapter are built, they need to be packaged into PCI option ROM compatible image format.
UEFI drivers stored in PCI option ROMs are automatically loaded and executed by the PCI bus driver
during PCI enumeration.
The EDK II tools provide two methods to generate a PCI Option ROM image. These are the EfiRom utility
and the EDK II INF/FDF file syntax.
Using the build command, each allows a UEFI Driver developer to describe how UEFI Drivers should be
packaged into a PCI Option ROM image as part of the standard EDK II build process.
Use either PCI Option ROM image with a PROM programmer or a flash update utility to reprogram the PCI
option ROM container on a PCI adapter.

18.7.1 EfiR om Utility
18.7.1 EfiRom Utility
The EfiRom utility is included with the standard set of tools from the EDK II project. A pre-built binary of
EfiRom is in the BaseTools/Bin/Win32 directory in the EDK II WORKSPACE . This directory, with pre-built binaries, is
automatically added to the path after setting up the EDK II environment, so EfiRom is always available.
The sources to EfiRom are in the BaseTools/Source/C/EfiRom directory so the utility can be built for any
operating system supporting the EDK II.
Use the EfiRom utility to build PCI Option ROM Images containing UEFI Drivers, PC BIOS legacy option ROM
images, or both, in a format conforming to the PCI 2.3 Specification and PCI 3.0 Specification. The
EfiRom utility also allows UEFI Drivers to be compressed using the UEFI compression algorithm defined in
the Compression Algorithm Specification section of the UEFI Specification.
The EfiRom utility performs some rudimentary checks on the UEFI Drivers to verify they are valid PE/COFF
images as defined by the Microsoft Portable Executable and Common Object File Format Specification. If
any of these checks fail, the utility aborts without creating the output ROM image file. For example, the
following checks are performed on UEFI Drivers:
V erification that the DOS stub magic value is 0x5A4D
V erification that the PE signature is " PE\0\0 "
The EfiRom utility also performs rudimentary checking of PC BIOS legacy option ROM images. If any of
these checks fail, the utility aborts without creating the output ROM image file. The following checks
are performed on PC BIOS legacy option ROMs:
V erification that the signature of the option ROM header is 0xAA55
V erification that the offset to the PCI data structure is within the range of the file siz e.
V erification that the signature of the PCI data structure is "PCIR"
.
The following example shows the help information from the EfiRom utility that is displayed when the utility
is run with no input parameters, the -h option or the -help option.

18.7.2 Using INF File to Generate PCI Option ROM Image
Use the INF file to specify the information required to package a UEFI Driver into a PCI Option ROM image
without having to manually run the EfiRom utility . Chapter 7 covers Driver Entry Points and includes a
number of example INF files. The following example shows an expanded version of the AbcDriverMinimum
from Chapter 7 and also shows how the PCI Option ROM related information can be specified. The only
changes are the addition of the PCI statements in the [Defines] section. These PCI statements allow the
V endor ID, Device ID, Class Code, and R evision values to be specified and they are used to fill in the PCI
Option ROM headers. The PCI
_
COMPRESS statement specifies whether the UEFI Driver should be
compressed using the UEFI compression algorithm or not. If a statement is not present, the value is
assumed to be 0 If the PCI statements are present, and if the UEFI Driver is successfully built, the PCI
Option ROM image is then automatically generated. The one limitation of this method is that the PCI
Option ROMs are allowed to contain only a single UEFI Driver.

18.7.3 Using FDF File to Generate PCI Option ROM Image
When managing large numbers of UEFI Drivers and PCI Option ROMs, greater flexibility than the EfiRom
utility or the INF methods allow may be required. The EDK II build system supports an FDF file format that
provides methods to package UEFI Drivers into FLASH devices. The FDF file format also supports the
description of PCI Option ROMs. The EDK II build system requires a DSC file to build UEFI Drivers. The DSC
file format is covered in more detail in Chapter 30. A DSC file can optionally specify an associated FDF
file in the [Defines] section of the DSC file with a FLASH
_
DEFINITION statement. The example below shows
the [Defines] section of a DSC file specifying the FDF file AbcDriver.fdf . The FDF file is typically in the same

ROM images are not limited to a single UEFI Driver. The following example shows an FDF file that
produces three PCI Option ROM images called AbcDriverAll.rom , AbcDriverIA32.rom , and AbcDriverX64.rom . The
first PCI Option ROM image contains a UEFI Driver image compiled for IA32 and a UEFI Driver image
compiled for X 64 The syntax for specifying the PCI related definitions is the same as the INF example in
the previous section. The second PCI Option ROM image contains only one UEFI Driver compiled for IA32
The third image contains one UEFI Driver compiled for X 64 The UEFI Drivers are compressed in all three

This chapter shows how to write host controller drivers and USB device drivers. USB drivers must follow
all of the general design guidelines described in Chapter 4 of this guide. In addition, any USB host
controllers that are PCI controllers must also follow the PCI-specific design guidelines (see Chapter 18).
Note: USB device drivers do not typically include HII functionality because they do not have configurable
information. For example, USB device drivers are typically for hot-plug devices.
The figure below shows an example of a USB driver stack and the protocols the USB drivers consume
and produce. Because the USB hub is a special kind of device that simply acts as a signal repeater, it is
not included in Figure 21.

19.1 USB Host Controller Driver
19.1 USB Host Controller Driver
The USB host controller driver depends on which USB host controller specification the host controller is
based. Currently, the major types of USB host controllers are the following:
Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) (USB 1.0 and USB 1.1)
Universal Host Controller Interface (UHCI) (USB 1.0 and USB 1.1)
Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI) (USB 2.0)
Extended Host Controller Interface (X HCI) (USB 3.0)
The USB host controller driver is a device driver and follows the UEFI driver model. It typically consumes
the services of EFI

19.1.1 Driver Binding Protocol Supported()
19.1.1 Driver Binding Protocol Supported()
The USB host controller driver must implement the EFI
DRIVER
BINDING
_
_
_
PROTOCOL containing the Supported() ,
Start() , and Stop() services. The Driver Binding Protocol is installed into the Handle Database in the
drive entry point.
The Supported() service evaluates the ControllerHandle that is passed in to check if the ControllerHandle
represents a USB host controller that the USB host controller driver knows how to manage. The typical
method of implementing this evaluation is for the USB host controller driver to retrieve the PCI
configuration header from this controller and check the Class Code field and possibly other fields such
as the Device ID and V endor ID. If all these fields match the values that the USB host controller driver
knows how to manage, the Supported() service returns EFI
_
SUCCESS . Otherwise, the Supported() service
returns EFI
UNSUPPORTED .
_
The following example shows an example of the Supported() service for the USB host controller driver
managing a PCI controller with Class code 0x30c.
First, it attempts to open the PCI I/O Protocol EFI
OPEN
PROTOCOL
BY
_
_
_
_
DRIVER . If the PCI I/O Protocol cannot be
opened, then the USB host controller driver does not support the controller specified by
ControllerHandle. If the PCI I/O Protocol is opened, the services of the PCI I/O Protocol are used to read
the Class Code from the PCI configuration header. The PCI I/O Protocol is always closed with
CloseProtocol() , and EFI
SUCCESS is returned if the Class Code fields match.

19.1.2.1 Support for legacy devices
Some USB host controllers provide legacy support to be compatible with legacy devices. Under this
mode, the USB input device, including mouse and keyboard, act as if they are behind an 8042 keyboard
controller. A UEFI implementation uses the native USB support rather than the legacy support.
As a result, the USB legacy support must be disabled in the Start() service of the USB host controller
driver, before enabling the USB host controller. This step is required because the legacy support
conflicts with the native USB support provided in UEFI USB driver stack. The example below shows how
to turn off USB legacy support for a UHCI 1.1 Host Controllers.

19.1.4 USB 2 Host Controller Protocol Data T ransfer Services
19.1.4 USB 2 Host Controller Protocol Data T ransfer Services
The USB2 Host Controller Protocol provides an I/O abstraction for a USB host controller. A USB host
controller is a hardware component that interfaces to a Universal Serial Bus (USB). It moves data
between system memory and devices on the Universal Serial Bus by processing data structures and
generating transactions on the Universal Serial Bus.
This protocol is used by a USB bus driver to perform all data transactions over the Universal Serial Bus.
It also provides services to manage the USB root hub integrated into the USB host controller.
Appendix A provides a template for the implementation of the USB Host Controller Protocol. The services
of the USB 2 Host Controller Protocol can be categoriz ed into the following categories:
Host controller general information
GetCapability()
R oot hub-related services:
GetR ootHubPortStatus()
SetR ootHubPortFeature()
ClearR ootHubPortFeature()
Host controller state-related services:
GetState()
SetState()
R eset()
USB transfer-related services:
ControlT ransfer()
BulkT ransfer()
AsyncInterruptT ransfer()
SyncInterruptT ransfer()
IsochronousT ransfer()
AsyncIsochronousT ransfer()
For root hub-related services and host controller state-related services, implementation mainly involves
read/write operations to specific USB host controller registers. The USB host controller data sheet
provides information on these register usages, so this topic is not covered in detail here.
This section concentrates on the USB transfer-related services. Those transfers are categoriz ed as
either asynchronous or synchronous.
With asynchronous transfers, the transfer does not complete with the service's return. With
synchronous transfers, the requested transfer has completed when the service returns. The following
sections discuss these two types of transfers in more detail.
19.1.4.1 Synchronous transfer
The USB Host Controller Protocol provides the following four synchronous transfer services:
ControlTransfer()
BulkTransfer()
SyncInterruptTransfer()
IsochronousTransfer()
Control and bulk transfers are completed in an acceptable period of time and thus are natural
synchronous transfers in the view of an UEFI system.
Interrupt transfers and isochronous transfers can be either asynchronous or synchronous transfers,
depending on the usage model.

EDK II Driver W riter's Guide for UEFI 2.3.1[DRAFT]
19.1.4 USB 2 Host Controller Protocol Data T ransfer Services
It is convenient for the USB drivers to use synchronous transfer services because there is no worry
about when the data is ready . The transfer result is available as soon as the function returns.
The following is an example of how to use BulkTransfer() to implement a synchronous transfer service.
Generally speaking, implementing a bulk transfer service can be divided into the following steps:
Preparation: For example, USBSTS is a status register in the USB host controller. The status register
needs to be cleared before starting the control transfer.
Setting up the DMA direction: By judging the end point address, the USB driver decides the transfer
direction and sets up the PCI bus master read operation or write operation. For example, if the
transfer direction is EfiUsbDataIn , the USB host controller reads from the DMA buffer. A bus master
write operation is required.
Building the transfer context: The USB Specification defines several structures for a transfer. For
example, Queue Head (QH) and T ransfer Descriptor (TD) are special structures used to support the
requirements of control, bulk, and interrupt transfers.
In this step, these QH and TD structures are created and linked to the Frame List. One possible
implementation can be creation of one QH and a list of TDs to form a transfer list. The QH points to the
first TD and occupies one entry in the Frame List.
Executing the TD and getting the result: The USB host controller automatically executes the TD when the
timer expires. The UHCI driver waits until all of the TDs associated with the transfer are all
completed. After that, the result of the TD execution is determined.
Cleaning up: Delete the bulk transfer QH and TD structures from the Frame List, free related
structures, and unmap the PCI DMA operation.
19.1.4.2 Asynchronous transfer
The USB Host Controller Protocol provides the following two asynchronous transfer services:
AsyncInterruptTransfer()
AsyncIsochronousTransfer()
T o support asynchronous transfers, the USB host controller driver registers a periodic timer event.
Meanwhile, it maintains a queue for all asynchronous transfers. When the timer event is signaled, the
timer event callback function evaluates this queue and checks to see if asynchronous transfers are now
complete.
Generally speaking, the main work of the timer event callback function is to go through the
asynchronous transfers queue. For each asynchronous transfer, it checks whether an asynchronous
transfer is completed or not and performs the following:
If not completed: The USB host controller driver takes no action and leaves the transfer on the
queue.
If completed: The USB host controller driver copies the data that it received to a predefined data
buffer and removes the related QH and TD structures. It also invokes a preregistered transfer
callback function. Based on that transfer's complete status, the USB host controller driver takes
different additional actions such as:
If completed without error, update the transfer data status accordingly, e.g., data toggle bit.
If completed with error, it is suggested that the USB host controller do nothing and leave the
error recovery work to the related USB device driver.
19.1.4.3 Internal Memory Management
T o implement USB transfers, the USB host controller driver manages many small memory fragments as
transfer data (i.e. QH and TD). If the USB host controller driver uses the system memory management
services to allocate these memory fragments each time, then the overhead can be large. As a result, it

EDK II Driver W riter's Guide for UEFI 2.3.1[DRAFT]
19.1.4 USB 2 Host Controller Protocol Data T ransfer Services
is recommended that the USB host controller driver manage these kinds of internal memory usage
itself . One possible implementation, as in EDK II, is that the host controller driver can allocate a large
buffer of memory in the Driver Binding Protocol Start() service using UEFI memory services. The USB
host controller driver provides a small memory management algorithm to manage this memory to satisfy
internal memory allocations. By using this simple memory management mechanism, it avoids the
frequent system memory management calls.
19.1.4.4 DMA
Most USB host controllers use DMA for their data transfer between host and devices. Because the
processor and USB host controller both access that transfer data simultaneously, the USB host
controller driver must use a common buffer for all the memory that the host controller uses for data
transfer. This requirement means that the processor and the host controller have an identical view of
memory . See Chapter 18 for usage guidelines for managing PCI DMA for common buffers.

If UEFI-based system firmware is ported to a new platform, most of the USB-related changes occur in the
implementation of the USB host controller driver. If new types of USB devices are introduced that
provide console or UEFI boot capabilities, the implementation of new USB Device Drivers is also
required.
The USB bus driver is designed to be a generic, platform-agnostic driver. As a result, customiz ing the
USB bus driver is strongly discouraged . The detailed design and implementation of the USB bus driver is not

19.3.1 Driver Binding Protocol Supported()
USB device drivers must implement the EFI
DRIVER
BINDING
_
_
_
PROTOCOL that contains the Supported() , Start() ,
and Stop() services. The Supported() service checks the passed-in controller handle to determine
whether this handle represents a USB device that the driver knows how to manage.
The following is the most common method for doing the check:
Check if this handle has EFI
USB
IO
_
_
_
PROTOCOL installed. If not, this handle is not a USB device on the
current USB bus.
Get the USB interface descriptor back from the USB device. Check whether the values of this
device's InterfaceClass, InterfaceSubClass, and InterfaceProtocol are identical to the corresponding
values this driver can manage.
If the handle passes the above two checks, the USB device driver can manage the device that the
controller handle represents and the Supported() service returns EFI
_
SUCCESS . Otherwise, the Supported()
service returns EFI
_
UNSUPPORTED . In addition, this checking process must not disturb the current state of
the USB device because the USB device may be managed by another USB device driver.
The example below shows an implementation of the Driver Binding Protocol Supported() service for a USB
keyboard driver. It opens the USB I/O Protocol with an attribute of EFI
OPEN

BY
DRIVER . It then uses
_
_
_
_
the UsbGetInterfaceDescriptor() service of the USB I/O Protocol and evaluates the class, subclass, and
protocol fields of the interface descriptor to see if the description is for a USB keyboard.

19.3.2.1 Example using a USB mass storage device
This discussion provides detailed guidance on how to implement a USB device driver. It uses a USB mass
storage device as an example. For example, suppose this mass storage device has the following four
endpoints:
One control endpoint
One interrupt endpoint
T wo bulk endpoints
For the interrupt endpoint, it is synchronous. For the bulk endpoints, one is an input endpoint and the
other is an output endpoint. The following discussions cover how to implement the Start() and Stop()
driver binding protocol services and UEFI Block I/O protocol.
This example shows a portion of the private context data structure for a USB mass storage device
driver. See Chapter 8 of this guide for more information about design guidelines for private context data
structures.

19.3.4 State machine consideration
19.3.4 State machine consideration
T o implement USB device support, the USB device drivers must maintain a state machine for their own
transaction process. For example, the USB mass storage driver must maintain a tri-state machine,
which contains Command->[Data]->Status states.
It should work well because it looks like a handshake process that is designed to be error free.
Maintaining this state machine should provide robust error handling.
However, imagine the following situation:
A command is sent to the device that the host needs some data from the device.
The device's response is too slow and it keeps NAK in its data endpoint.
The host sees the NAK so many times that it thinks there is no data available from the device. It
timeouts this data-phase operation.
The state machine is then in the status phase. It asks for the status data from the device.
The device then sends the real data-phase data to the host.
The host cannot understand the data from the device as status data, so it resets the device and
retries the operation.
The necessary components of a dead loop then exist. The final result is a system likely to hang, an
unusable device, or both.
How can this situation be avoided? If the device keeps NAK, then sooner or later the data becomes
available and no assumption can be made about the data's availability . There are some cases in which
the device's response is so slow that the timeout is not enough for it to get data ready . As a result,
retrying the transaction in the data phase may be necessary .
TIP: Make sure USB device drivers maintain a state machine for their own transaction process. The
driver might need to retry transactions in the data phase in order to avoid dead loops and other errors.

usage of the DEBUG() and ASSERT() macros). Messages may be sent at the entry point and exit point of
functions. When this is done, a log of the call stack is produced that may help locate the source of the
error. It is not suggested to print the debug message in a frequently called function, such as a timer
handler because this can starve execution cycles at lower TPLs and can significant change the behavior
of the drivers under debug.

There are still some conditions that the DEBUG() and ASSERT() macros are not sufficient for a developer

bus analyz er is inserted between the host and the device, the bus analyz er can monitor all the traffic on
a single USB cable. Having access to the USB bus traffic information can make it easier to root cause
some difficult bugs-for example, when a host controller loses packets on some occasions. Also, for the
state machine chaos problem that was introduced in Section 19.3.4, a bus analyz er can display the
packet sequences and the unfinished state machine. This can help quickly solve that type of problem.

for a generic imaging device such as a digital camera. If an enduser claims that this driver does not
work for his or her specific brand of digital camera, and the developer does not have such a camera on
hand, the developer can ask the user to use the USBCheck/USBCV tool set and find out the device's
InterfaceClass, InterfaceSubClass, and InterfaceProtocol. The developer can then use this information
to evaluate whether the camera should be supported by the driver.

19.5 Nonconforming USB Devices
19.5 Nonconforming USB Devices
There are debates on how best to handle devices that do not conform to the USB Specification. It is
recommended that the driver stack comply with the USB Specification and reject any nonconforming
devices. A nonconforming device that is not linked into the USB software stack should not interact
further with the system.
However, even if the device is nonconforming and the USB driver stack should reject it, developers need
to make sure that the nonconforming device does not cause system failures. The developer must not
make any assumptions about the device's behavior, especially since, once a system is known not to
conform, its behavior cannot be trusted. It can respond to addressing that was not meant for that
device; it can corrupt data going into it and coming back from it; and it cannot be trusted to perform its
intended function(s). It is essential for the end-user's experience that the nonconforming device does
not negatively affect the system.
A driver can only reliably reject nonconforming devices that it already knows about. For USB devices, the
identity of devices may be determined by use of the data in the USB device description packets.
USB devices have several sets of known issues that may be detected and hidden from the user. For
example, some keyboards auto-repeat when keys are pressed for an extended period of time. In this
case the consuming driver should simply ignore packets which repeatedly provide identical information.
Media devices also have several issues. USB requires implementation of the SCSI or A T API specifications,
which, for many e.g. thumb drives, is beyond their capacity . As such, relying only on basic commands
can greatly increase the probability of functionality .

Consumes the SCSI I/O Protocol and produces an I/O abstraction that provides
services for the console devices and boot devices that are required to boot an EFI-
conformant operating system.
This chapter shows how to write UEFI Drivers for SCSI host controllers and UEFI Drivers for SCSI devices.
SCSI drivers must follow all of the general design guidelines described in Chapter 4 of this guide. In
addition, any SCSI host controllers that are PCI controllers must also follow the PCI-specific design
guidelines described in Chapter 18. This chapter covers the guidelines that apply specifically to the
management of SCSI host controllers, SCSI channels, and SCSI devices. SCSI drivers, especially those for
RAID controllers, may include HII functionality for SCSI subsystem configuration settings. HII functionality
is described in Chapter 12 of this guide.
The EFI 1.10 Specification defines the SCSI Pass Thru Protocol. UEFI Drivers for SCSI host controllers that
are required to work properly on platforms that conform to the EFI 1.10 Specification are required to
produce the SCSI Pass Thru Protocol and also produce the Block I/O protocol for physical and logical
drives that the SCSI host controller manages. This implies that a UEFI Driver for the SCSI host controller
in an EFI 1.10 platform is required to perform all the functions of the SCSI driver stack described in the
table above. The UEFI 2.0 Specification and above require the platform firmware to provide the SCSI bus
driver and SCSI device driver for mass storage devices, so the implementation of a UEFI Driver for a SCSI
host controller is simpler if the UEFI Driver is only required to function properly on platforms that
conform to the UEFI 2.0 Specification and above.

20.1 SCSI Host Controller Driver
A SCSI host controller driver manages a SCSI host controller that contains one or more SCSI channels. It

A SCSI host controller driver follows the UEFI driver model. Depending on the adapter that it manages, a
SCSI host controller driver can be categoriz ed as either a device driver or a hybrid driver. It creates child
handles for each SCSI channel (if there is more than 1) and it may also install protocols on its own
handle. T ypically, SCSI host controller drivers are chip-specific because of the requirement to initializ e
and manage the currently bound SCSI host controller.
Because there may be multiple SCSI host adapters in a platform that may be managed by a single SCSI
host controller driver, it is recommended that the SCSI host controller driver be designed to be re-
entrant and allocate a different private context data structure for each SCSI host controller.

20.1.3 SCSI Adapters with RAID
A SCSI host controller driver may also support SCSI adapters with RAID capability . The following figure
shows an example implementation with two physical SCSI channels and one logical channel. The two
physical channels are implemented on the SCSI adapter. The RAID component then configures these
two channels to produce a logical SCSI channel. The two physical channels each have Extended SCSI
Pass Thru installed, but these are not be used except for diagnostic use. For the logical channel, the
SCSI host controller driver produces another Extended SCSI Pass Thru Protocol (with physical bit turned
off) instance based on the RAID configuration. R equests sent to the Extended SCSI Pass Thru protocol
for the logical channel are processed by the SCSI host controller drivers and converted into requests on
the physical SCSI channels. The platform firmware must only enumerate and boot from SCSI targets
present on the logical SCSI channel.
Figure 24-S ample S CS I driver implementation on multichannel RAID adapter
The SCSI adapter hardware may not be able to expose the physical SCSI channel(s) to upper-level
software when implementing RAID. If the physical SCSI channel cannot be exposed to upper software,
then the SCSI host controller driver is only required to produce a single logical channel for the RAID.
Although the basic theory is the same as the one on a physical channel, it is different from a
manufacturing and diagnostic perspective. If the physical SCSI channels are exposed, any SCSI
command, including diagnostic ones, can be sent to an individual channel, which is very helpful on
manufacturing lines. Furthermore, the diagnostic command can be sent simultaneously to all physical
channels using the non-blocking mode that is supported by Extended SCSI Pass Thru Protocol. The
diagnostic process may considerably benefit from the performance gain. In summary, it is suggested to
expose physical SCSI channel whenever possible.

20.1.4 Implementing driver binding protocol
20.1.4 Implementing driver binding protocol
A SCSI host controller driver follows the UEFI driver model, so the image entry point of a SCSI host
controller driver installs the Driver Binding Protocol instance on the image handle. All three of the
services in the Driver Binding Protocol- Supported() , Start() , and Stop() -must be implemented by a SCSI
host controller driver.
20.1.4.1 Supported()
The Supported() function tests to see if a given controller handle is SCSI adapter the driver knows how to
manage. In this function, a SCSI host controller driver checks to see if the EFI
DEVICE
PATH
_
_
_
PROTOCOL and
EFI
PCI
IO
_
_
_
PROTOCOL are present to ensure the handle that is passed in represents a PCI device. In
addition, a SCSI host controller driver checks the ClassCode, V endorId, and DeviceId from the device's
PCI configuration header to see if it is a conformant SCSI adapter that can be managed by the SCSI host
controller driver.
20.1.4.2 Start()
The Start() function tells the SCSI host controller driver to start managing the SCSI host controller. In
this function, a single channel SCSI host controller driver uses chipspecific knowledge to perform the
following tasks:
Initializ e the SCSI host controller.
Enable the PCI device.
Allocate resources.
Construct data structures for the driver to use.
Install the Extended SCSI Pass Thru Protocol instance on the same handle that has the PCI I/O
Protocol.
If the SCSI adapter is a multi-channel adapter, then the driver should also do the following:
Enumerate the SCSI channels that are supported by the SCSI host controller.
Create child handles for each physical SCSI channel.
Append the device path for each channel handle.
Install the Device Path Protocol and Extended SCSI Pass Thru Protocol on every newly created
channel handle.
20.1.4.3 Stop()
The Stop() function performs the opposite operations as Start() . Generally speaking, a SCSI driver is
required to do the following:
Disable the SCSI adapter.
R elease all resources that were allocated for this driver.
Close the protocol instances that were opened in the Start() function.
Uninstall the protocol interfaces that were attached on the host controller handle.
In general, if it is possible to design a SCSI host controller driver to create one child at a time, it should
do so to support the rapid boot capability in the UEFI driver model.
Each of the channel child handles created in Start() must contain a Device Path Protocol instance and
a Extended SCSI Pass Thru abstraction layer.

Before implementing Extended SCSI Pass Thru Protocol, the SCSI host controller driver configures the
SCSI host controller to a defined state. In practice, the SCSI adapter maps a set of SCSI host controller
registers in I/O or memory-mapped I/O space. Although the detailed layout or functions of these
registers vary from one SCSI hardware to another, the SCSI host controller driver uses specific
knowledge to set up the proper SCSI working mode (SCSI-I, SCSI-II, Ultra SCSI, and so on) and configure
the timing registers for the current mode. Other considerations include parity options, DMA engine and
interrupt initializ ation, among others.
All the hardware-related settings must be completed before any Extended SCSI Pass
Thru Protocol functions are called. The initializ ation is usually performed in the Driver Binding Protocol's
Start() function of the SCSI host controller driver prior to installing the Extended SCSI Pass Thru
Protocol instance into the Handle Database.

the nonblocking attribute is also set. The example below shows how to set those attributes on a non-

PROTOCOL.BuildDevicePath() function facilitates the construction of a SCSI device path.
The Extended SCSI Pass Thru Protocol may be used to abstract access to many different types of

this function is part of the Extended SCSI Pass Thru Protocol.

PROTOCOL.PassThru() function is the most important function when implementing
Extended SCSI Pass Thru Protocol and it performs the following:
Initializ e the internal register for command/data transfer.
Put valid SCSI packets into hardware-specific memory or register locations.
Start the transfer.
Optionally wait for completion of the execution.
The better error handling mechanism in this function helps to develop a more robust driver. Although
most SCSI adapters support both blocking and non-blocking data transfers, some may only support
blocking transfers. In this case, the SCSI driver may implement the blocking SCSI I/O that is required by
the UEFI Specification using the polling mechanism. Polling can be based on a timer interrupt or simply
by polling the internal register. Do not return until all I/O requests are completed or else an unhandled
error is encountered.

20.1.6 SCSI command set device considerations
20.1.6 SCSI command set device considerations
Extended SCSI Pass Thru Protocol defines a method to directly access SCSI devices. This protocol
provides interfaces that allow a generic driver to produce the Block I/O Protocol for SCSI mass storage
devices and allows a UEFI utility to issue commands to any SCSI device. The main reason to provide such
an access is to enable S.M.A.R.T . functionality during POST (i.e., issuing Mode Sense, Mode Select, and
Log Sense to SCSI devices). This enabling is accomplished using the generic interfaces that are defined
in Extended SCSI Pass Thru Protocol. The implementation of this protocol also enables additional
functionality in the future without modifying the SCSI drivers that are built on top of the SCSI host
controller driver. Furthermore, Extended SCSI Pass Thru Protocol is not limited to SCSI adapters. It is
applicable to all channel technologies that use SCSI commands such as A T API, iSCSI, and Fibre Channel.
This section shows some examples that demonstrate how to implement Extended SCSI Pass Thru
Protocol on SCSI command set-compatible technology .
20.1.6.1 A T API
This section provides guidance on how to implement the Extended SCSI Pass Thru Protocol for A T API
devices.
Decoding the T arget and Lun pair uses the intrinsic property of the technology or device. For A T API, only
four devices are supported, so the T arget and Lun pair can be decoded by determining the IDE channel
(primary/secondary) and IDE device (master/slave).
If the corresponding technology or device supports the channel reset operation, use it to implement
EFI
EXT
SCSI

20.1.7 Discover a SCSI channel
20.1.7 Discover a SCSI channel
It is recommended that the SCSI host controller driver construct a private context structure for each
enumerated SCSI channel. See Chapter 8 in this guide for the advantage of using such a private
context structure.
Specifically, the SCSI host controller driver should store all required information for the child SCSI
channel in this data structure, this should including the signature, child handle value (optional for
single channel controller), channel number, and any produced protocols. This private context structure
can be accessed via the R ecord macro CR() , which is described in Chapter 8 of this document.
The method for determining the number of channels on a given controller is chip specific and varies by
manufacturer. It is also the SCSI driver's responsibility to do the following:
Build the appropriate device path for the enumerated SCSI channel.
Install Extended SCSI Pass Thru Protocol and Device Path Protocol on the appropriate handle (child
handle is optional for single channel).

The SCSI host controller driver described in this document support a SCSI channel that is generated or
emulated by multiple architectures, such as SCSI-I, SCSI-II, SCSI-III, A T API, Fibre Channel, iSCSI, and other
future channel types. This section describes four example device paths, including SCSI, A T API, and Fibre
Channel device paths.
20.1.8.1 SCSI Device Path Example
The table below shows an example device path for a SCSI host controller that supports a single SCSI
channel and is located at PCI device number 0x07 and PCI function 0x00 The PCI SCSI host controller is
directly attached to a PCI root bridge.
This sample device path consists of an ACPI device path node, a PCI device path node, and a device
path end structure. The
HID and
_
_
UID must match the ACPI table description of the PCI root bridge. The
following is the shorthand notation for this device path: ACPI(PNP0A03,0)/PCI(7|0).

20.1.8.2 Multiple SCSI channels on a multifunction PCI controller
A SCSI host controller with multiple SCSI channels on a multi-function PCI controller only changes the PCI
portion of the device path for each SCII channel. In this example, SCSI channel 0 is accessed through
PCI function #0, and SCSI channel 1 is accessed through PCI function #1 The following are the device
paths for these SCSI channels:
ACPI(PNP0A03,1)/PCI(7|0) - Access to channel 0
ACPI(PNP0A03,1)/PCI(7|1) Access to channel 1
20.1.8.3 Multiple SCSI channels on a single function PCI controller
If there is a SCSI PCI controller with multiple SCSI channels connected to a single-function PCI device, the
device paths must differentiate the SCSI channels. In this example, SCSI channel 0 is accessed through
Controller #0 below PCI function #0, and SCSI channel 1 is accessed through Controller #1 below PCI
function #1. The following are the device paths for these SCSI channels:
ACPI(PNP0A03,1)/PCI(7|0)/Controller(0) - Access to channel 0
ACPI(PNP0A03,1)/PCI(7|0)/Controller(1) - Access to channel 1
20.1.9 Using Extended SCSI Pass Thru Protocol
If a SCSI driver supports both blocking and non-blocking I/O modes, any client of the SCSI driver can use
them to perform SCSI I/O.
The following example demonstrates how to use Extended SCSI Pass Thru Protocol to perform blocking
and non-blocking I/O.

R etrieve the 8-bit SCSI device type to see if the type is one that this driver can manage.
If the above two checks are passed, it means that the SCSI device driver can manage the device that
the controller handle represents. The Supported() service returns EFI
_
SUCCESS . Otherwise, the Supported()
service returns EFI
_
UNSUPPORTED . In addition, this check process must not disturb the current state of the
SCSI device, because a another SCSI device driver may be managing this SCSI device.

This chapter shows how to write UEFI Drivers for A T A host controllers. A T A drivers must follow all of the
general design guidelines described in Chapter 4 of this guide. In addition, any A T A host controllers that
are PCI controllers must also follow the PCIspecific design guidelines described in Chapter 18. This
section covers the guidelines that apply specifically to the management of A T A host controllers. A T A
drivers, especially those for RAID controllers, may include HII functionality for A T A subsystem
configuration settings. HII functionality is described in Chapter 12 of this guide.

Protocol.
An A T A host controller driver is a device driver that follows the UEFI driver model. T ypically, A T A host
controller drivers are chip-specific because of the requirement to initializ e and manage the currently
bound A T A host controller. Because there may be multiple A T A host adapters in a platform that may be
managed by a single A T A host controller driver, it is recommended that the A T A host controller driver be
designed to be re-entrant and allocate a different private context data structure for each A T A host
controller.
An A T A host controller driver performs the following:
Install the A T A Pass Thru Protocol onto the controller handle for the A T A host controller.
Install Extended SCSI Pass Thru Protocol onto the controller handle for the SCSI host controller.
The platform firmware typically provides the A T A Bus Driver that completes the A T A driver stack by
performing the following actions:
Use the services of the A T A Pass Thru Protocol to scan for A T A targets connected to the A T A host
controller and create child handles.
Install Device Path Protocol to each child handle.
Install Block I/O Protocol on each child handle.
Install Block I/O 2 Protocol on each child handle.
If the hard drive supports the SPC-4 or A T A8-ACS command set, then install the Storage Security
Command Protocol the child handle.

21.1.1 Implementing Driver Binding Protocol
21.1.1 Implementing Driver Binding Protocol
An A T A host controller driver follows the UEFI driver model, so the image entry point of a A T A host
controller driver installs the Driver Binding Protocol instance on the image handle. All three of the
services in the Driver Binding Protocol- Supported() , Start() , and Stop() -must be implemented by a A T A
host controller driver.
21.1.1.1 Supported()
The Supported() function tests to see if a given controller handle is an A T A controller the driver knows
how to manage. In this function, an A T A host controller driver checks to see if the EFI
DEVICE
PATH
_
_
_
PROTOCOL
and EFI
PCI
IO
_
_
_
PROTOCOL are present to ensure the handle that is passed in represents a PCI device. In
addition, an A T A host controller driver checks the ClassCode, V endorId, and DeviceId from the device's
PCI configuration header to see if it is a conformant A T A controller that can be managed by the A T A host
controller driver.
21.1.1.2 Start()
The Start() function tells the A T A host controller driver to start managing the A T A host controller. In this
function, an A T A host controller driver uses chip-specific knowledge to perform the following tasks:
Initializ e the A T A host controller.
Enable the PCI device.
Allocate resources.
Construct data structures for the driver to use.
Install the A T A Pass Thru Protocol instance on the same handle that has the PCI I/O Protocol.
Install the Extended SCSI Pass Thru Protocol instance on the same handle that has the PCI I/O
Protocol.
If the A T A host controller provides RAID capabilities, then the A T A host controller driver can either
choose to only expose access to the logical drives following the algorithm above, or the A T A host
controller driver can produce two instances of the A T A Pass Thru Protocol. One for accessing the
physical drives, and another for accessing the logical drives. In this case, a child handle is created for
each A T A Pass Thru Protocol instance.
21.1.1.3 Stop()
The Stop() function performs the opposite operations as Start() . Generally speaking, an A T A host
controller driver is required to do the following:
Disable the A T A controller.
R elease all resources that were allocated for this driver.
Close the protocol instances that were opened in the Start() function.
Uninstall the protocol interfaces that were attached on the host controller handle.

Before implementing A T A Pass Thru Protocol, the A T A host controller driver configures the A T A host
controller to a defined state. In practice, the A T A host controller maps a set of A T A host controller
registers in I/O or memory-mapped I/O space. Although the detailed layout or functions of these
registers vary from one A T A host controller to another, the A T A host controller driver uses specific
knowledge to set up the proper A T A mode and configure the timing registers for the current mode.
Other considerations include DMA engine and interrupt initializ ation, among others.
All the hardware-related settings must be completed before any A T A Pass Thru Protocol functions are
called. The initializ ation is usually performed in the Driver Binding Protocol's Start() function of the A T A
host controller driver prior to installing the A T A Pass Thru Protocol instance into the Handle Database.

A T A Pass Thru Protocol defines a method to directly access A T A devices. This protocol provides
interfaces that allow a generic driver to produce the Block I/O Protocol for A T A devices and allows a UEFI
utility to issue commands to any A T A device. The main reason to provide such an access is to enable
S.M.A.R.T . functionality during POST . This enabling is accomplished using the generic interfaces that are
defined in A T A Pass Thru Protocol. The implementation of this protocol also enables additional
functionality in the future without modifying the A T A Bus Driver that is built on top of the A T A host
controller driver.

22 T ext Console Driver Design Guidelines
22 T ext Console Driver Design Guidelines
This chapter covers the general guidelines for implementing UEFI Drivers for devices that provide
console services. This include devices that allow the user to input information though key press actions
such as a keyboard or keypad, devices that provide text based output, and byte-stream devices like a
UAR T that can be connected to a remote terminal to provide console services.
If a device is intended to be used as a console input device and that device must be available for use
as a console input device while UEFI firmware is active, then a UEFI Driver must be implemented that
produces both the Simple T ext Input Protocol and the Simple T ext Input Ex Protocol. The Simple T ext In
Protocols are produced for any device that can behave like a basic keyboard. This could be an actual
keyboard such as USB or PS/2, a serial terminal, a remote network terminal such as T elnet, or a custom
device that provide the ability for a user to perform actions that can be translated into UEFI compatible
keystroke information.
If a device is intended to be used as a console output device while UEFI firmware is active, and that
device is able to display text strings, then a UEFI Driver must be implemented that produces the Simple
T ext Output Protocol. The device must support an 80 column by 25 row character mode, and may
optionally support additional modes. The device must either directly support or be able to emulate the
following operations:
Clear the display
Scroll the display up
Move cursor
T urn cursor on and off
Support 16 foreground colors
Support 8 background colors
If a device is graphics controller that is able to emulate a text console using bitmap fonts, then see
Chapter 23 on the Graphics Output Protocol. The EDK II provides a platform agnostic driver in the
MdeModulePkg in the directory MdeModulePkg/Universal/Console/GraphicsConsoleDxe that uses the services of a
Graphics Output Protocol and bitmap fonts to produce the Simple T ext Output Protocol.
If a device supports character based communication where data can be both transmitted and received
character at a time, and the goal is to use that device for console services by connecting the device to
terminal or terminal emulator, then a UEFI Driver must be implemented that produces the Serial I/O
Protocol. This may include devices such as a UAR T style serial port or any other character based I/O
device on a motherboard, an add-in card, or USB.
The EDK II provides a terminal driver that supports the PC-ANSI, VT -100, VT -100+, and VT -UTF8 terminal
types. This terminal driver is in the MdeModulePkg in the directory MdeModulePkg/Universal/Console/TerminalDxe . This
driver consumes the Serial I/O Protocol and produces all the Simple Input Protocol, the Simple Input Ex
Protocol, and the Simple T ext Output Protocol.

Implement the Reset() and ReadKeyStroke() services in SimpleTextInput.c that is shared between the

Implement the SetState() , RegisterKeyNotify() and UnregisterKeyNotify() services in SimpleTextInput.c for the
Simple T ext Input Ex Protocol.
Implement notification function for the W aitForK ey and W aitForK eyEx events in SimpleTextInput.c that is
shared between the Simple T ext Input Protocol and the Simple T ext Input Ex Protocol.
Create W aitForK ey and W aitForK eyEx events before the Simple Input Protocols are installed into the
Handle Database.
If a device does not buffer keystrokes, or the buffer is very small, a timer event may be required to
periodically read contents from a keyboard buffer.
Example 223, following, shows the protocol interface structure for the Simple T ext Input Protocol and
Example 224, below that, shows the protocol interface structure for the Simple T ext Input Ex Protocol for
reference. These two protocols are composed of services and each has an EFI
_
EVENT that may be used
by the UEFI Boot Manager or UEFI Applications to determine if a keystroke has been pressed. The UEFI
Boot Services WaitForEvent() and CheckEvent() can be used to perform these checks on the events
specified by W aitForK ey and W aitForK eyEx.

The reset function is for resetting the input device hardware. This only takes a single parameter which
is whether to do an extended or a basic functionality test following the reset operation. This functions
implementation is dependent on the underlying hardware specifications. However, it is recommended
that the basic functionality test perform as quickly as an operation as possible to support fast boot

follow are:

1. V erify that the current mode is good.
2. Check each character to see if it is printable as text or graphics. Characters that are not printable
as text or graphics are skipped.
3. Print all printable characters.

22.3.4 QueryMode() Implementation
22.3.4 QueryMode() Implementation
The QueryMode() function returns information supported modes. The UEFI Driver is required to return the
number of R ows and number of Columns for each supported ModeNumber. ModeNumber must be less
than Mode->MaxMode .
Note: All devices that support the Simple T ext Output Protocol must minimally support an 80 x 25
character mode. Additional modes are optional. This means a basic Simple T ext Output Protocol
implementation supports a single ModeNumber of 0 with a geometry of 80 Columns and 25 R ows, and
reports a Mode->MaxMode value of 1.
The QueryMode() function is typically used one of two ways:
1. Query for the geometry of the current mode. The following line populates the Columns and R ows
variables with the geometry of the currently active console output.

The Write() and Read() functions are used to write bytes out to the serial device or read in from the
serial device. The only two parameters that are passed are the number of bytes and then either the
buffer to write out or a buffer to read the bytes into. The amount of time that this can take is
determined by the timeout value in the Mode structure (as set by SetAttributes() ).
Some serial devices support FIFOs. At the time the W rite() service is called, the FIFO could be full which
means the entire FIFO may need to flush before any new characters can be added to the FIFO. In this
case, the time that a UEFI Driver may be required to wait may be longer that the time specified by the
TimeOut value in the Mode structure. The caller is not aware of the FIFO depth, so it is not correct to
return an EFI
_
TIMEOUT error if the timeout is due to a full FIFO. Instead, the UEFI Driver should detect the
FIFO depth if possible and wait to that number of character times.

23 Graphics Driver Design Guidelines
23 Graphics Driver Design Guidelines
This chapter covers the general guidelines for implementing UEFI Drivers for graphics controllers. Most
graphics controllers are PCI controllers, and this implies that UEFI Drivers for graphics controllers are
typically PCI drivers. PCI drivers must follow all of the PCI design guidelines described in Chapter 18, as
well as the general guidelines described in Chapter 4 of this guide. Also see the R ules for PCI/AGP
Devices section of the UEFI Specification.
If a device is intended to be used as a graphics console output device while UEFI firmware is active,
then a UEFI Driver must be implemented that produces the Graphics Output Protocol. The graphics
controller must either directly support or be able to emulate the following operations:
Block transfer to fill a region of the frame buffer
Block transfer from system memory to region of frame buffer
Block transfer from region of frame buffer to system memory
Block transfer between two regions of the frame buffer
Query attached display devices for EDID information
Set the supported graphics modes that is intersection of modes that the graphics controller
supports and the display device supports
The EDK II provides a platform agnostic driver in the MdeModulePkg in the directory
MdeModulePkg/Universal/Console/GraphicsConsoleDxe that uses the services of a Graphics Output Protocol and
bitmap fonts to produce the Simple T ext Output Protocol. This means if a Graphics Output Protocol is
produced by a UEFI Driver, then the frame buffer managed by that UEFI Driver can be used as a text
console device without having to implement the Simple T ext Output Protocol in the UEFI Driver for the
graphics controller.

23.1 Assumptions
The rest of this chapter assumes that the Driver Checklist in Chapter 2 has been followed and that the
following items have already been identified:
UEFI Driver T ype
Optional UEFI Driver features
Supported CPU architectures
Consumed protocols that are used to produce the graphics controller related protocols.
If the UEFI Driver is required to be compiled for EBC, then see Chapter 18 for PCI optimiz ations and
Chapter 29 for EBC considerations. UEFI Drivers for graphics controllers are typically more sensitive to
the EBC virtual machine interpreter overheads, so it is critical that the performance guidelines are
followed for a UEFI Driver for a graphics controller that is compiled for EBC to have good performance.
UEFI Drivers for graphics controllers typically follow the UEFI driver model. Some graphics controllers
have a single output controller, and other may have multiple output controllers. In both cases, a child
handle must be created for each output controller, which means UEFI Drivers for graphics controllers
are always either Bus Drivers or Hybrid Drivers. They are never Device Drivers. UEFI Drivers for graphics
controllers are chip-specific because of the requirement to initializ e and manage the graphics device.
UEFI drivers that manage graphics controllers typically follow the UEFI Driver Model because the devices
are typically on industry standard busses such as PCI. However, it is possible to implement UEFI drivers
for graphics controllers that are not on industry standard busses. In these cases, a R oot Bridge Driver
implementation that produces a handle for each output controller in the driver entry point may be more
appropriate than a UEFI Driver Model implementation.

The Start() function tells the Graphics driver to start managing the controller. In this function, a
Graphics driver should use chip-specific knowledge to do the following:

1. Initializ e the adapter.
2. Enable the PCI device.
3. Allocate resources.
4. Construct data structures for the driver to use (if required by the device).

13. In order to support faster boot times, a default mode set and clear screen operation must not be
performed in the Start() function. This allows the UEFI Boot Manager to select the best mode for the
current boot scenario and set the mode one time.
The Start() function should not scan for devices every time the driver is started. It should depend on
RemainingDevicePath parameter to determine what to start. Only if NULL was passed in should the driver
should create a device handle for each device that was found in the scan behind the controller.
Otherwise the driver should only start what was specified in RemainingDevicePath .
The Stop() function performs the opposite operations as Start() . Generally speaking, a Graphics driver
is required to do the following:
1. Uninstall all protocols on all child handles and close all the child handles.
2. Uninstall all protocols that were attached on the host controller handle.
3. Close all protocol instances that were opened in the Start() function.

23.2.4 QueryMode(), SetMode(), and Blt() Implementation
23.2.4 QueryMode(), SetMode(), and Blt() Implementation
There are three functions that make up one method: QueryMode() , SetMode() , and Blt() . The mode pointer
is pointing to a structure that has members so that the consumer of the GOP protocol can get
information about the current state.
The QueryMode() function is used to return extended information on one of the supported video modes.
For example, the protocol consumer could iterate through all of the valid video modes and see what
they offer in terms of resolution, color depth, etc. This function has no effect on the hardware or the
currently displayed image. It is critical that QueryMode() only return modes that can actually be displayed
on the attached display device. This means that the UEFI Driver must evaluate the modes that that
graphics controller supports and the modes that the attached display supports and only reports the
intersection of those two sets. Otherwise, a consumer of the Graphics Output Protocol may attempt to
set a mode that cannot be displayed.
The SetMode() function is how the consumer of the Graphics Output Protocol selected the specific mode
to become active. SetMode() is also required to clear the entire display output and reset it all to black.
The Blt() function is for transferring information (Block T ransfer) to and from the video frame buffer.
This is how graphics content is moved to and from the video frame buffer and also allows graphics
content to be moved from one location of the video frame buffer to another location of the video frame
buffer. The prototype of the Blt() function is shown below .

23.2.4 QueryMode(), SetMode(), and Blt() Implementation
In this function the driver must translate the entire Blt operation into the correct commands for the
graphics adapter that it is managing. This can by be done by performing PCI memory mapped I/O or port
/IO operations or by performing a DMA operation. The exact method is specific to the graphics silicon.
A critical consideration of implementing the Blt() function is to get the highest performance possible
for the user. A common problem is that scrolling the screen results in significant lags such that the user
experiences a less than optimal perception. This could be caused by the lags that are normally present
when reading back from the frame buffer. A possible solution is to have a copy of the current frame
buffer in a memory buffer for use in reads.
The screen is defined in terms of pixels and the buffer is formatted as follows. For a given pixel at
location X ,Y the location in the buffer is Buffer[((Y*<<ScreenWidth>>)+X)] . The screen is described according
to the following figure.
Figure 28-S oftware BL T Buffer
An important optimiz ation to make in graphics drivers is for scrolling. Scrolling is one of the most
common operations to occur on a pre-boot graphics adapter due to the common use of text based
consoles. A method to scroll the screen can be viewed in EDK II in the GraphicsConsole driver
( \MdeModulePkg\Universal\Console\GraphicsConsoleDxe ).
The EFI

MODE object pointed to by the Mode pointer is populated when the graphics
controller is initializ ed, and must be updated whenever SetMode() is called. The FrameBufferBase
member of this object may be used by a UEFI OS Loader or OS K ernel to update the contents of the
graphical display after ExitBootServices() is called and the Graphics Output Protocol services are not
longer available. A UEFI OS may choose to use this method until an OS driver for the graphics controller
can be installed and started.

24 Mass Storage Driver Design Guidelines
24 Mass Storage Driver Design Guidelines
This chapter covers the general guidelines for implementing UEFI Drivers for mass storage devices. Most
mass storage devices reside on industry standard busses such as A T A, SCSI, or USB. This means that
the design guidelines as described in Chapter 21 for A T A, Chapter 20 for SCSI, or Chapter 19 for USB
must be followed along with the general guidelines described in Chapter 4 of this guide.
If a mass storage device is intended to be used as a boot device for a UEFI operating system or UEFI
applications, then a UEFI Driver must be implemented that produces the Block I/O Protocol. If the UEFI
Driver is required to be conformant with the UEFI Specification 2.3.1 or higher, then the Block I/O 2
Protocol must also be produced. If the mass storage device supports the SPC-4 or A T A8-ACS security
commands, then the Storage Security Command Protocol must also be produced. A mass storage
device must either directly support or be able to emulate the following operations:
R ead blocks of data from the mass storage device.
W rite blocks of data to the mass storage device.
Determine the siz e of the blocks on the mass storage device.
Determine the total number of blocks on the mass storage device.
If the mass storage device supports removable media, then methods must exist to determine if
media is present, media is not present, and if the media has been changed.
If a mass storage device does not meet these requirements, but still must support being used as a
boot device, then consider implementing a UEFI Driver that produces either the Simple File System
Protocol or the Load File Protocol. Please see the Media Access chapter of the UEFI Specification for
details on the Simple File System Protocol and Chapter 27 for details on the Load File Protocol.
The EDK II provides a set of platform agnostic drivers in the MdeModulePkg and the FatBinPkg that consume
the Block I/O Protocols and produce the Simple File System Protocol which is one of the two protocols
from which a UEFI Boot Manager is able to boot a UEFI operating system or a UEFI application. These
platform agnostic drivers allow the contents of the mass storage media to be accessed without any
specializ ed knowledge of the specific device or controller. The set platform agnostic drivers UEFI Drivers
include:

MdeModulePkg/Universal/Disk/PartitionDxe

Optional UEFI Driver features
Supported CPU architectures
Consumed protocols that are used to produce the mass storage device related protocols.
UEFI drivers that manage mass storage devices typically follow the UEFI Driver Model because these
devices are typically on industry standard busses such as USB, SCSI, or A T A. However, it is possible to
implement UEFI Drivers for mass storage devices that are not on industry standard busses supported
by the UEFI Specification. In these cases, a R oot Bridge Driver implementation that produces a handles
for mass storage devices in the driver entry point may be more appropriate than a UEFI Driver Model
implementation.

25 Network Driver Design Guidelines
This chapter focuses on the design and implementation of UEFI Drivers for network interface controllers.
These UEFI Drivers typically bus drivers follow the UEFI Driver Model. Some example devices include add-
in PCI network adapters, USB network controllers, cardbus network cards, and LAN-on-motherboard
network devices. This list illustrates that most network interface controllers are PCI devices or USB
devices. As a result, the UEFI Drivers for network interface controllers must follow all of the design
guidelines described in Chapter 18 for PCI or Chapter 19 for USB, and must also follow the general
guidelines described in Chapter 4.
If a network interface controller is intended to be used as a boot device for a UEFI operating system or
UEFI applications, then a UEFI Driver must be implemented that produces Network Interface Identifier
Protocol and UNDI, the Simple Network Protocol, or the Managed Network Protocol. If the network
interface controller hardware supports VLAN, then the VLAN Config Protocol must be implemented. If the
UEFI Driver for a network interface controller only produces the Managed Network Protocol, then the
UEFI Driver must also produce the VLAN Config Protocol even if the network interface controller does not
support VLAN.
All three UEFI Driver designs for network interface controllers are covered in this chapter. There are
several factors that affect the design of a UEFI Driver for a network interface controller. The following
table summariz es the major features for each of the three possible UEFI Driver designs.

The EDK II provides a set of platform agnostic drivers in the MdeModulePkg and the NetworkPkg that consume
the protocols produced by a UEFI Driver for a network interface controller and produce the Load File
Protocol which is one of the two protocols from which a UEFI Boot Manager is able to boot a UEFI
operating system or a UEFI application. The Load File Protocol allows a UEFI operating system or UEFI
application to be booted from a properly configured PX E server. The platform agnostic drivers allow the
services provided by the network interface controller to be accessed without any specializ ed knowledge
of the specific device or controller. The set platform agnostic UEFI Drivers include:

Consumed protocols that are used to produce the network interface controller related protocols.
UEFI drivers that manage network interface controllers typically follow the UEFI Driver Model because the

implement UEFI drivers for network interface controllers that are not on industry standard busses. In
these cases, a R oot Bridge Driver implementation that produces a handle for network interface

25.2 NII Protocol and UNDI Implementations
25.2 NII Protocol and UNDI Implementations
Network drivers that follow the UNDI definition from the UEFI Specification are unique compared to all
others peripheral drivers.
UEFI Drivers that produce UNDI interfaces must be UEFI R untime Drivers. This allows a UEFI operation
system to potentially use the services of this UEFI R untime Driver to provide basic network
connectivity in boot scenarios where the OS driver for the network interface controller is not
available.
UNDI is not a protocol interface. The Network Interface Identifier Protocol defines the entry point to
the UNDI structure, but UNDI itself is not a protocol. The Command Descriptor Block (CDB) that the
caller passed into each UNDI request must provide services that allow the UNDI to access the
network interface controller hardware.
See the Universal Network Driver Interfaces appendix of the UEFI Specification for more details on
UNDI adapters.
Figure 29-UEFI UNDI Network S tack
The implementation of the Network Interface Identifier Protocol is typically found in the file NiiUndi.c.
Appendix A contains a template for a NiiUndi.c file for a UEFI Driver. The list of tasks to implement the

Create an Exit Boot Services Event to disable DMA when packets are received.
Create a Set Virtual Address Map Event to convert physical addresses to virtual addresses.
The following example shows the protocol interface structure for the Network Interface Identifier
Protocol for reference. The Network Interface Identifier Protocol is different from many other protocols in
that it has no functions inside it, and instead is only composed of data fields. These data fields share
information with the platform about the network interface controller capabilities. The field called Id
provides the address of a data structure for the UNDI that includes methods for the platform to call the
UNDI interfaces.

25.2.1 Exit Boot Services Event
UEFI Drivers for network interface controllers that perform DMA operations to a buffer in system memory
in response to a received packet must create an Exit Boot Services Event in the Driver Binding Protocol
Start() function. The notification function associated with this Exit Boot Services Event must update the
network interface controller hardware to disable all further DMA activity . This guarantees that after
ExitBootServices() is called, that the receive resources allocated to network driver are freed for OS usage.
Caution: If the network interface controller performs DMA due to received packets into system memory
after ExitBootServices() is called, the DMA operations may corrupt memory that is now owned by the
operating system.

and pointers within those allocations must be converted to virtual addresses when a UEFI operating
system calls the UEFI R untime Service SetVitualAddressMap() . UEFI Drivers for network interface controllers
that manage this type of buffer must create a Set Virtual Address Map Event in the Driver Binding
Protocol Start() function. The notification function associated with this Set Virtual Address Map Event
must use the UEFI R untime Service called ConvertPointer() to perform conversions from physical
addresses to virtual addresses on all pointers. These conversions must be performed bottom-up since
the virtual pointers are not valid until the SetVirtualAddressMap() returns to the UEFI operating system.

25.2.3 Memory leaks caused by UNDI
25.2.3 Memory leaks caused by UNDI
UNDI drivers transfer data in the system through memory buffers. T o perform its function, the UNDI
driver often allocates many buffers for data transfer. If those buffers are not tracked properly, it is
possible to lose them in the shuffle, and they are not returned to the system memory management.
This can cause a memory leak. When a buffer is being used (taken off the waiting queue and made
active) there is a chance of losing the pointer to that buffer in the process, which again, causes a
memory leak.
When transmitting, the UNDI driver must keep track of which buffers have been completed, and return
those buffer addresses from the GetStatus API. This allows the top level stack to disposition the buffer
(reuse or de-allocate) and not leak memory .

25.3 Simple Network Protocol Implementations
25.3 Simple Network Protocol Implementations
Exposing SNP instead of NII and UNDI has some advantages and some disadvantages over using NII and
UNDI. SNP-based network drivers are never UEFI R untime Drivers, so such drivers do not have to worry
about meeting the UEFI R untime Driver requirements. This allows an SNP driver to be compiled for all the
CPU architectures supported by the UEFI Specification including EBC. SNP may be required for some
nonstandard network interface controllers that cannot meet the UNDI requirements.
When a network driver exposes SNP directly the system firmware layers MNP on top of SNP and does not
use its internal SNP driver as part of this network stack.
The following figure shows a possible network stack based on a network driver producing SNP . The
inclusion of Load File Protocol is not guaranteed here, but is a choice made by the system firmware.
Figure 30-S NP Based Network S tack
The implementation of the Simple Network Protocol is typically found in the file SimpleNetwork.c.
Appendix A contains a template for a SimpleNetwork.c file for a UEFI Driver. The list of tasks to
implement the Simple Network Protocol is as follows:
Add global variable for the EFI

_
EVENT that can be used to poll when a
packet has been received, and a Mode structure that contains details on the attributes and capabilities
of the network interface controller.

Exposing MNP instead has many of the same advantages of implementing SNP and it reduces one extra

Config Protocol must also be implemented. In addition, the Managed Network Protocol also requires a
Service Binding Protocol to be implemented. See Chapter 10 covering the Service Binding Protocol. In
many cases, since two additional protocols must be implemented in addition to the Managed Network

27 Load File Driver Design Guidelines
27 Load File Driver Design Guidelines
The Load File Protocol is used to support booting from a device type which does not fit cleanly into any
of the standard device types supported by the UEFI Specification. A UEFI Boot Manager can only boot
through the Simple File System Protocol or the Load File Protocol. If a device must be a boot device and
cannot directly or indirectly produce the Simple File System Protocol or indirectly produce the Load File
Protocol, then a Load File Protocol must be implemented. The indirect production of Simple File System
and the Load File Protocol may not always be obvious. The EDK II provides a number of platform-agnostic
drivers that help produce the Simple File System Protocol and the Load File Protocol through several
layers of UEFI drivers. For example, a UEFI Driver that produces the Block I/O Protocol is sufficient to
produce the Simple File System Protocol if the Disk I/O Driver, Partition Driver, and FA T File System Driver
are also included in the platform. R eview all the other boot device types described in this guide and the
UEFI Specification before choosing to implement the Load File Protocol.
Note: The Load File Protocol should not be implemented for any standard device type which has a
defined driver hierarchy (e.g. USB, SCSI, and A T A).

28 IPF Platform Porting Considerations
When writing a UEFI driver, there are steps that can be taken to help make sure the driver functions
properly on an IPF platform. The guidelines listed in this chapter help improve the portability of UEFI
drivers, and explain some of the pitfalls that may be encountered when a UEFI driver is ported to an IPF
platform.
Chapter 4 covers the general guidelines for implementing a UEFI Driver that is compatible with both 32-
bit and 64-bit CPU architectures. If a 32-bit UEFI Driver is being ported to IPF, then make sure the
guidelines from Chapter 4 are followed. This chapter focuses on issues that are specific to IPF . In
general, the guidelines for implementing a UEFI Driver for IPF are more rigorous that other CPU
architectures. If a UEFI Driver is implemented and validated for IPF, then there is a good chance that the
UEFI Driver can be easily ported to most of the other CPU architecture supported by the UEFI
Specification.
In addition, the DIG64 Specification requires some protocols that are considered obsolete by the latest
UEFI Specification. This means UEFI Drivers for IPF may have to produce some extra protocols from older
versions of the EFI Specification and UEFI Specification in order to be conformant with the DIG64
Specification. The additional protocols are listed below . Other chapters of the guide provide
recommendations on how to implement these protocols and this topic will not be covered further in this

28.1 General notes about porting to IPF platforms
28.1 General notes about porting to IPF platforms
When porting to IPF platform, most developers take as much code as possible that already exists and
reuse it for the IPF platform. Unfortunately, some developers porting code do not rigorously follow the
UEFI conventions, such as using only the data types defined in the Calling Conventions section of the
UEFI Specification. Others may not follow best coding practices. This is a critical issue for IPF platforms
because, although such code might work the first time, it may fail a more complete set of validation
tests. It is also very likely that the code may not work when compiled with a different compiler, or after
another developer performs maintenance on the code.
Use data types defined by the Calling Conventions section of the UEFI Specification.
Use compiler flag settings that guarantee that the UEFI calling conventions for IPF are followed.
If a UEFI driver contains assembly language sources for a different CPU architecture, then those
sources must be converted to either IPF assembly language sources or to CPU agnostic C language
sources. Conversion to C language sources is recommended and the EDK II library BaseLib and other
EDK II libraries provide functions that may reduce or eliminate the need to assembly code in UEFI
Drivers.
A void alignment faults. This is the top issue in porting a UEFI driver to an IPF platform. Alignment
faults may be due to type casting, packed data structures, or unaligned data structures.

28.2 Alignment Faults
28.2 Alignment Faults
The single most common issue with UEFI drivers for IPF platforms is alignment. Alignment faults cannot
occur on IA32, X 64, or EBC platforms, but can occur on IPF platforms. The IPF platform requires that all
transactions be performed only on natural boundaries. This requirement means that a 64-bit read or
write transaction must begin on an 8-byte boundary, a 32-bit read or write transaction must begin on a
4-byte boundary, and a 16-bit read or write transaction must begin on a 2-byte boundary .
In most cases, the driver writer does not need to worry about this issue because the C compiler
guarantees that accessing global variables, function parameters, local variables, and fields of data
structures do not cause alignment faults.
Alignment faults can be generated when:
C code can generate an alignment fault when a pointer is cast from one type to another or when
packed data structures are used.
Data structures are declared to be byte packed using #pragma pack(1) or equivalent.
Assembly language can generate an alignment fault, but it is the assembly programmer's
responsibility to ensure alignment faults are not generated. This topic is not covered further in this
guide.

28.3 Casting Pointers
28.3 Casting Pointers
The example below shows an example that generates an alignment fault on an IPF platform. The first
read access through SmallV aluePointer is aligned because LargeV alue is on a 64-bit boundary . However,
the second read access though SmallV aluePointer generates an alignment fault because
SmallV aluePointer is not on a 32-bit boundary . The problem is that an 8-bit pointer was cast to a 32-bit
pointer. Whenever a cast is made from a pointer to a smaller data type to a pointer to a larger data
type, there is a chance that the pointer to the larger data type is unaligned.
Example 243-Pointer-cast alignment fault
# include <Uefi.h>
UINT64 LargeValue;
UINT32*SmallValuePointer;
UINT32 SmallValue;
SmallValuePointer = (UINT32 *) &LargeValue;
//
// Works
//
SmallValue =*SmallValuePointer;
SmallValuePointer = (UINT32 *)((UINT8*)&LargeValue + 1);
//
// Fails. Generates an alignment fault
//
SmallValue = *SmallValuePointer;
Example 244, below, shows the same example as Example 243, above, but has been modified to
prevent the alignment fault. The second read access through SmallV aluePointer is replaced with a call
to the EDK II library BaseLib function called ReadUnaligned32() that treats the 32-bit value as an array of
bytes. The individual bytes are read and combined into a 32-bit value. The generated object code is
larger and slower, but it is functional on all CPU architectures supported by the UEFI Specification.
Example 244-Corrected pointer-cast alignment fault
# include <Uefi.h>
# include <Library/BaseLib.h>
UINT64 LargeValue;
UINT32*SmallValuePointer;
UINT32 SmallValue;
SmallValuePointer = (UINT32 *) &LargeValue;
//
// Works

SmallValue =*SmallValuePointer;
SmallValuePointer = (UINT32 *)((UINT8*)&LargeValue + 1);
//
// Works
//
SmallValue = ReadUnaligned32 (SmallValuePointer);
EDK II library BaseLib provides several functions to help perform unaligned accessed in a safe manner.
These functions perform a direct access on CPU architectures that do not generate alignment faults,
and break the access up into small aligned pieces on CPU architectures that do generate alignment

The following example shows another example that generates an alignment fault on an IPF platform.

never aligned on a 4-byte boundary .

28.4 Packed Structures
If a data structure is copied from one location to another, then both the source and the destination
pointers for the copy operation should be aligned on a 64-bit boundary . The EDK II library BaseMemoryLib
provides the CopyMem() service that handles unaligned copy operations, so an alignment fault is never
generated by the copy operation itself .
However, if the fields of the data structure at the destination location are accessed, they may generate
alignment faults if the destination address is not aligned on a 64-bit boundary . There are cases where
an aligned structure may be copied to an unaligned destination, but the fields of the destination buffer
must not be accessed after the copy operation is completed. An example of this case is when a packed
data structure is built and stored on a mass storage device or transmitted on a network.

28.5 UEFI Device Paths
28.5 UEFI Device Paths
The technique of using the EDK II library BaseLib functions to perform unaligned reads and writes is
functional, but can become tedious if a large number of fields in data structures need to be accessed.
In these cases, it may be necessary to copy a data structure from an unaligned source location to an
aligned destination location so that the fields of the data structure can be accessed without
generating an alignment fault. T wo examples of this scenario are parsing UEFI device path nodes and
parsing network packets.
The device path nodes in a UEFI device path are packed together so they take up as little space as
possible when they are stored in environment variables such as ConIn, ConOut, StdErr, Boot####, and
Driver####. As a result, individual device path nodes may not be aligned on a 64-bit boundary . UEFI
device paths and UEFI device paths nodes may be passed around as opaque data structures, but
whenever the fields of a UEFI device path node are accessed, the device path node must be copied to a
location that is guaranteed to be on a 64-bit boundary . Likewise, network packets are packed so they
take up as little space as possible. As each layer of a network packet is examined, the packet may need
to be copied to a 64-bit aligned location before the individual fields of the packet are examined.
The following example shows an example of a function that parses a UEFI device path and extracts the
32-bit HID and UID from an ACPI device path node. This example generates an alignment fault if
DevicePath is not aligned on a 32-bit boundary .
Example 247-UEFI device path node alignment fault
# include <Uefi.h>
# include <Protocol/DevicePath.h>
VOID
EFIAPI
GetAcpiHidUid (

//
//
//
//
// Wrong. May cause an alignment fault.
*Hid = AcpiDevicePath->HID;
// Wrong. May cause an alignment fault.
*Uid = AcpiDevicePath->UID;
}
Example 248, below, shows the corrected version of Example 247, above. Because the alignment of
DevicePath cannot be guaranteed, the solution is to copy the ACPI device path node from DevicePath
into an ACPI device path node structure that is declared as the local variable AcpiDevicePath. A
structure declared as a local variable is guaranteed to be on a 64-bit boundary on IPF platforms. The
fields of the ACPI device path node can then be safely accessed without generating an alignment fault.

28.6 PCI Configuration Header 64-bit BAR
28.6 PCI Configuration Header 64-bit BAR
Another source of alignment faults is when 64-bit BAR values are accessed in a PCI configuration
header. A PCI configuration header has room for up to six 32-bit BAR values or three 64-bit BAR values. A
PCI configuration header may also contain a mix of both 32-bit BAR values and 64-bit BAR values. All 32-
bit BAR values are guaranteed to be on a 32-bit boundary . However, 64-bit BAR values may be on a 32-
bit boundary or a 64-bit boundary . As a result, every time a 64-bit BAR value is accessed, it must be
assumed to be on a 32-bit boundary in order to guarantee that an alignment fault is not generated.
The following two methods can be used to prevent an alignment fault when a 64-bit BAR value is
extracted from a PCI configuration header:
Use ReadUnaligned64() to read the BAR contents
Use CopyMem() to transfer the BAR contents into a 64-bit aligned location.
Collect the two 32-bit values that compose the 64-bit BAR, and combine them into a 64-bit value.
The example below shows the incorrect method of extracting a 64-bit BAR from a PCI configuration
header, and then shows three correct methods.

correctly to guarantee that these calling conventions are followed. The EDK II provides proper compiler
and linker settings for several tool chains that support IPF platforms. These settings may have to be
adjusted if updates to a tool chain are release or if a different tool chain is used. The following table

29 EFI Byte Code Porting Considerations
There are a few considerations to keep in mind when writing drivers that may be ported to EBC (EFI byte
code). This chapter describes these considerations in detail and, where applicable, provides solutions
to address them. If UEFI drivers are implemented with these considerations in mind, the C code may not
require any changes. In this case, a native driver may be ported to EBC simply by recompiling the driver
sources using the Intel(R) C Compiler for EFI Byte Code. The tasks required to convert a UEFI Driver to
an EBC include the following:
Port assembly language sources to C language sources.
Port C++ language sources to C language sources.
Eliminate use of the float type.
Convert floating point math operations to integer math operations.
Eliminate use of siz eof() in statements that require a constant.
A void arithmetic operations and comparisons between natural integers and fixed siz e integers.
Some specific combinations produce unexpected results.

29.4.1 Global V ariable Initialization
In a native compile the value of sizeof (UINTN) is computed by the compiler at compile time. This can be
done because the compiler already knows the instruction set architecture. The EBC compiler cannot do
that in the same way . Instead, it generates code to calculate this value at execution time if the result is
different on different CPU architectures. This limitation means that EBC code cannot use sizeof (UINTN) ,
sizeof (INTN) , and sizeof (VOID *) (or other pointer types) in C language statements that require constant
expressions.
Note: The type EFI
_
ST A TUS is required to by type UINTN by the UEFI Specification. This means that a
variable of type EFI
_
ST A TUS cannot be used in C language statements that require constant
expressions. The code in the following example fails when compiled for EBC.
Example 251-Global V ariable Initialization that fails for EBC
# include <Uefi.h>

29.4.2 CASE Statements
Because pointers and the data types INTN and UINTN are different siz es on different instruction set
architectures and case statements are determined at compile time; the sizeof() function cannot be
used in a case statement with an indeterminately siz ed data type because the sizeof() function cannot
be evaluated to a constant by the EBC compiler at compile time. UEFI status codes values such as
EFI
SUCCESS and EFI
_
_
UNSUPPORTED are defined differently on different CPU architectures. As a result, UEFI
status codes cannot be used in case expressions. The following example shows examples using case
statements.

result, a UEFI driver that is compiled with an EBC compiler should be optimiz ed for performance to
improve the usability of the UEFI Driver. Chapter 4 covers speed optimiz ation techniques that may be
used to improve the performance of all UEFI Drivers.
The simplest way to maximiz e the speed of a UEFI Driver compiled for EBC is to maximiz e the use of UEFI
Boot Services, UEFI R untime Services, and protocols produced by other UEFI components. These calls
outside of the UEFI Driver compiled for EBC help improve performance because those other services
may be native calls that can be executed without the overhead of the EBC virtual machine interpreter. If
all UEFI Drivers compiled for EBC follow the recommendation, even if one UEFI Driver compiled for EBC
calls another UEFI Driver compiled for EBC, the overhead of the EBC interpreter is still minimiz ed.

29.7.1 Performance considerations for data types
A void declaration and initializ ation of variables or structures that contain native length data types such
as INTN , UINTN , and pointers. One of the issues with initializ ing variables occurs during optimiz ation. If
variables are initializ ed statically, the compiler optimiz es them for siz e and, for example, gives the
variable a 32-bit placement or a 16-bit placement. This can create problems if the variables are a siz e
that is different on different CPU architectures.
TIP: Initializ e variables separately from declaring them.
The amount of variable initializ ation that is performed during EBC runtime initializ ation can be
determined by viewing the PE/COFF sections of a UEFI Driver compiled for EBC. The linker provided with
Microsoft* tools provides a method to perform this operation.
The command is: link -dump -headers <filename> . This command dumps the different parts of an .EFI file. The
goal is to minimiz e the V ARBSS section while maximiz ing the .data and .rdata sections of the PE/COFF
image.

29.8 UEFI Driver Entry Point
29.8 UEFI Driver Entry Point
The entry point to an EBC compiled image is a function is always called EfiStart() . This is the function
that is shown as the entry point in the PE/COFF image that is produced by an EBC compile/link
operation. The EfiStart() function performs the EBC runtime initializ ation that may vary from one UEFI
Driver to another. At the end of the EBC runtime initializ ation, the function EfiMain() is called. The EDK II
build system and libraries take care of these details, so a UEFI Driver implementation never contains
functions with these names. In fact, the symbols EfiStart() and EfiMain() must be considered reserved,
and cannot be used as function names or variable names in any UEFI driver implementation that is
compiled for EBC.
The INF file for a UEFI Driver declares the C entry point in the [Defines] section in a define called
ENTRY
_
POINT . All UEFI Drivers are linked to the EDK II library instance from the MdePkg called
UefiDriverEntryPoint , and the UefiDriverEntryPoint library instance is responsible for calling the library
constructors for all the libraries that a UEFI Driver is using either directly or indirectly . Once all the library
constructors have been called, control is transferred to the ENTRY
POINT function defined in the INF file.
_
This is where the C sources for a UEFI Driver implementation begin and the driver specific initializ ation is
performed.
The sequence of calls in a UEFI Driver entry point compiled for EBC is as follows:
EfiStart() - PE/COFF entry point that performs the required EBC runtime initializ ation. Calls EfiMain() .
EfiMain() - Calls
_
ModuleEntryPoint()
_
ModuleEntryPoint() - Calls EDK II library constructors. Calls ENTRY
POINT function defined in INF file.
_
ENTRY
_
POINT function - Performs UEFI Driver specific initializ ation.
Knowledge of this specific sequence of calls is not typically required by a UEFI Driver developer because
it is very rare for anything to go wrong in EfiStart() , EfiMain() or
_
ModuleEntryPoint() functions. However, if
a UEFI Driver compiled for EBC is being debugged, it is important to know that these extra actions do
occur between the entry point of the PE/COFF image and the first line of C source code in the UEFI
Driver implementation.

30.1 Prerequisites
30.1 Prerequisites
Before a UEFI Driver can be built, an EDK II build environment must be established on a development
system. The EDK II project is maintained by the TianoCore community on GitHub, and validated releases
of the EDK II project are periodically posted. The current validated release as of June, 2017 is UDK2017.
It is recommended that a validated release be used for UEFI Driver development instead of the trunk
of the EDK II project, because the trunk is under active development. The validated release page
includes links to documentation to help setup a build environment on a development system. V erify that
one of the standard platforms builds correctly before proceeding.
In most cases, building a UEFI Driver only requires a few directories from an EDK II build environment.
These include:
BaseTools - Contains EDK II build tools
Conf - Contains configuration files for EDK II build tools and supported compilers and linkers
MdePkg - Contains the include files and libraries to support industry standard specifications. This
content includes all of the published UEFI Specifications and EFI Specifications as well as includes
files for industry standard buses such as PCI, USB, and SCSI.
MdeModulePkg - Contains UEFI Drivers that can be used as reference. Also contains HII related libraries
that may be used by UEFI Drivers that produce HII packages.
OptionRomPkg - Sample package with three UEFI Drivers and a UEFI Application that can be used as a
template for a device manufactures own package for UEFI Driver development.
MyDriverPkg - Example EDK II package that contains the UEFI Drivers implemented by a device
manufacturer. This directory name is only used for discussion purposes. Device manufacturers may
generate their own directory name for their own package and may generate more than one
package for their UEFI Driver content if required.

30.2 Create EDK II Package
30.2 Create EDK II Package
The first step is to make sure there is an EDK II package available to which a new UEFI Driver can be
added. If an EDK II package has already been created for UEFI Driver work, then this step may be
skipped. Otherwise the following steps are required:
Create a new directory that is a peer to MdePkg (e.g. MyDriverPkg ).
Create a subdirectory called Include (e.g. MyDriverPkg/Include ).
Create a subdirectory of Include called Protocol (e.g. MyDriverPkg/Include/Protocol ).
Create a subdirectory of Include called Guid (e.g. MyDriverPkg/Include/Guid ).
Create a subdirectory of Include called Library (e.g. MyDriverPkg/Include/Library ).
Add DEC file to the new package directory (e.g. MyDriverPkg/MyDriverPkg.dec ).
Add DSC file to the new package directory (e.g. MyDriverPkg/MyDriverPkg.dsc ).
The following example shows an example directory structure for an EDK II WORKSPACE after creating the
new package called MyDriverPkg following the steps listed above. The Include subdirectory is a place
holder in case new Protocols, GUIDs, or Library Classes are required to support new UEFI Driver
implementations.

30.3 Create UEFI Driver Directory
30.3 Create UEFI Driver Directory
The next step is to create a subdirectory in an EDK II package for the UEFI Driver contents including an
INF file and all source files required to build the UEFI Driver. There are no restrictions on the directory
structure organiz ation within an EDK II package. The examples shown here are simple and only use one
layer of directories. The MdeModulePkg is an example of an EDK II package with about 100 UEFI Drivers and
a more complex directory structure to organiz e the UEFI Drivers based on the protocol they consume
and the features they provide.
Appendix A contains a template for an INF file for a UEFI Driver and a UEFI R untime Driver. This template
should be sufficient for most UEFI Driver implementations. The EDK Build Specifications on
<http://www> .tianocore.org provide the full description of INF files and their supported syntax for
describing all the packages, sources, library classes, protocols, and GUIDs required to compile and link
a UEFI Driver.
The example below shows an example directory structure for an EDK II WORKSPACE after creating the
new package called MyDriverPkg following the steps listed above and creating a subdirectory called
MyDriver and adding an INF file and a C source file.

30.3.2 R eserved Directory Names
30.3.2 Reserved Directory Names
The UEFI Drivers in the two examples above do not contain any instruction set architecture-specific files.
This absence means that this driver is designed to be portable between all CPU architecture supported
by the UEFI Specification. If a UEFI Driver requires instruction set architecture-specific source files, then
those source files are typically placed in subdirectories below the UEFI driver's main directory in an EDK
II package. A separate subdirectory is required for each instruction set architecture that the UEFI Driver
supports. The table below lists the directory names that are reserved for the instruction set
architecture-specific files.
Ia32 Ipf Ebc X 64 Table 39-Reserved directory names
Directory name Notes
May contain .c , .h , and .asm files.
May contain .c , .h , and .s files.
May contain .c and .h files.
May contain .c , .h , and .asm files.
Note: Code written in EBC is still C language code, and the sources look the same as for any other
driver. It is when the compiler converts it from a high-level language (C) to object code (EBC versus
native code) that the difference becomes evident.
For EBC, the object code generated is not native to the processor but rather is pseudo-object-code
that looks like RISC processor object code. That code is fed into an interpreter, which interprets each
instruction and acts upon it. The EBC output is not 32-bit or 64-bit-based, but rather conforms to its
own standard. Thus a system with a valid interpreter for its architecture can translate EBC compiled
code into operational instructions on any given architecture.

30.3.3 EBC V irtual Machine Driver Example
The following example shows the directory structure for another driver that includes instruction set
architecture-specific files for three of the supported instruction sets. The files EbcLowLevel.asm and
EbcLowLevel.s contain logic that must be implemented in assembly to handle the transitions between
native execution and the EBC interpreter. Doing so makes the driver work on all three supported
architectures, but the UEFI driver takes longer to develop and is more difficult to maintain if any
changes are required in the instruction set architecture-specific components.
If possible, a UEFI driver should be implemented in C with no instruction set architecture-specific files,
which reduces the development time, reduces maintenance costs, and increases portability .

30.5 Building a UEFI driver
Building a UEFI Driver involves the use of the build.exe command provided with the
EDK II tools. If the pre-requisites were followed at the beginning of this chapter, then the only flag that
need to be passed into build.exe is the DSC file that is to be used for the build.
build -p MyDriverPkg/MyDriverPkg.dsc
If the build competes successfully, then the UEFI Driver generated can be found in the build output
directory that is specified in the DSC file. In the example above, OUTPUT
_
DIRECTORY is set to Build/MyDriverPkg .
The following example shows where MyDriver.efi is located. This specific example shows that a DEBUG
build was used with a Microsoft family compiler to generate MyDriver.efi for IA32.
Example 264-Build Output Directory

If a UEFI Driver needs to be built as a DEBUG build or a RELEASE build, this can be specified on the
command line. The following two examples show how to build for DEBUG and RELEASE . If the -b flag is not
specified, then the build type is retrieved from Conf/target.txt .
build -b DEBUG -p MyDriverPkg/MyDriverPkg.dsc
build -b RELEASE -p MyDriverPkg/MyDriverPkg.dsc
If a UEFI Driver needs to be built for other CPU architectures, then those can also be specified on the
command line. The following 4 examples show how to build for IA32, X 64, IPF, and EBC if the compiler
and linkers installed support all these architectures.
build -a IA32 -p MyDriverPkg/MyDriverPkg.dsc
build -a X64 -p MyDriverPkg/MyDriverPkg.dsc
build -a IPF -p MyDriverPkg/MyDriverPkg.dsc
build -a EBC -p MyDriverPkg/MyDriverPkg.dsc
The 4 separate commands above can also be combined into a single command:
build -a IA32 -a X64 -a IPF -a EBC -p MyDriverPkg/MyDriverPkg.dsc
The EDK II also supports a configuration file for builds in the file path Conf/target.txt .
This file may be updated with the specific configuration that is most commonly used. For example, the
ACTIVE
_
PLATFORM can be set to MyDriverPkg/MyDriverPkg.dsc , and the build command can then be invoked with
no parameters at all:
build
Please see the EDK II User's Manual and other EDK II documents for more details on how to use the
build command and for details on INF files, DEC files, and DSC files.

these forms allows the OEM firmware to simulate testing the driver in a fast, best-case scenario and a
slower scenario. If the driver is tested to work as both an EBC and native-instruction-set binary, it is
expected that there are fewer timing sensitivities to the driver, and it is more robust.

31.3.3 Loading UEFI drivers
Table 42-UEFI S hell commands for loading UEFI drivers
Command Description
Load
Loads a UEFI driver from a file. UEFI driver files typically have an extension of .efi .
The Load command has one important option, the -nc ("No Connect") option, for
UEFI driver developers. When the Load command is used without the -nc option,
then the loaded driver is automatically connected to any devices in the system that
it is able to manage. This means that the UEFI driver's entry point is executed and
then the UEFI Boot Service ConnectController() is called. If the UEFI driver produces
the Driver Binding Protocol in the driver's entry point, then the ConnectController() call
exercises the Supported() and Start() services of Driver Binding Protocol that was
produced. If the -nc option is used with the Load command, then this automatic
connect operation is not performed. Instead, only the UEFI driver's entry point is
executed. When the -nc option is used, the UEFI Shell command connect can be
used to connect the UEFI driver to any devices in the system that it is able to
manage. The Load command can also take wild cards, so multiple UEFI drivers can
be loaded at the same time. The code below shows the following examples of the
Load command:
Example 1: Loads and does not connect the UEFI driver image EfiDriver.efi . This
example exercises only the UEFI driver's entry point:
fs0:> Load -nc EfiDriver.efi
Example 2: Loads and connects the UEFI driver image called EfiDriver.efi . This
example exercises the UEFI driver's entry point and the Supported() and Start()
functions of the Driver Binding Protocol:
fs0:> Load EfiDriver.efi
Example 3: Loads and connects all the UEFI drivers with an .efi extension from
fs0: , exercising the UEFI driver entry points and their Supported() and Start()
functions of the Driver Binding Protocol:
`fs0:> Load .efi`
LoadPciR om
This command used to simulate the load of a PCI option ROM by the PCI bus driver.
It also supports the -nc flag like the Load command, but takes the name of a PCI
Option ROM file instead of an .efi file.

31.3.5 Connecting UEFI Drivers
The table below lists the UEFI Shell commands that can be used to test the connecting of UEFI drivers
to devices. There command support many flags, so only a few are shown in the table below .
Table 44-UEFI S hell commands for connecting UEFI drivers
Command Description
Connect Can be used to connect all UEFI drivers to all devices in the system or connect UEFI
drivers to a single device.
Disconnect Stops UEFI drivers from managing a device.
R econnect
Is the equivalent of executing the Disconnect and Connect commands back to back.
The Reconnect command is the best command for testing the Driver Binding Protocol
of UEFI drivers. This command tests the Supported() , Start() , and Stop() services of
the Driver Binding Protocol. The Reconnect -r command tests the Driver Binding
Protocol for every UEFI driver that follows the UEFI driver model. Use this command
before a UEFI driver is loaded to verify that the current set of drivers pass the
Reconnect -r test, and then load the new UEFI driver and rerun the Reconnect -r test. A
UEFI driver is not complete until it passes this interoperability test with the UEFI core
and the full set of UEFI drivers at least 3 times in a row .
31.3.5.1 Connect
This UEFI Shell command requests UEFI drivers to start managing a device. This command tests the
Driver Binding Protocol Supported() and Start() functions in the driver that has the specified handle. The
Start() function may create new child handles if the UEFI Driver is a bus driver or a hybrid driver.
The Connect command can be used to connect all UEFI drivers to all devices in the system or connect
UEFI drivers to a single device. Here are several examples of using the Connect command:
Example 1: Connects all drivers to all devices: fs0:> Connect -r
Example 2: Connects all drivers to the device that is abstracted by handle 23: fs0:> Connect 23
Example 3: Connects the UEFI driver on handle 27 to the device on handle 23: fs0:> Connect 23 27
In Example 3, note that there is a handle for the driver and a handle for the hardware device. The
Connect command makes the connection between the two handles. The Start() service associates the
driver with the specified hardware. If the driver needs to create a child handle for the device, it does so
as part of its Start() function. Although the handles cannot be known until the driver is executed, the
handle database can be evaluated to determine the handle numbers that are passed to the connect
command.
31.3.5.2 Disconnect
The Disconnect UEFI command stops UEFI drivers from managing a device. This command tests the Driver
Binding Protocol Stop() function in the driver.
This UEFI Shell command does not allow a driver to be disconnected unless all the child handles
associated with that driver are destroyed first. Basically, this UEFI Shell command does not allow any
orphans to be left in the system.
TIP: When disconnecting drivers one at a time, begin at the lowest level of child handle and work up the
device tree one node at a time. The UEFI Shell command devtree provides a device tree view .

31.3.5 Connecting UEFI Drivers
The code below shows the following examples of using the Disconnect command:
Caution: The Disconnect command supports a -r switch that can be used without any other
parameters. Do NOT use this mode of the Disconnect command because it will disconnect all UEFI
Drivers from all devices in the entire platform which typically includes the consoles devices.
Example 1: Disconnects all the UEFI drivers from the device represented by handle 23:
fs0:> Disconnect 23
Example 2: Disconnects all UEFI drivers on handle 23 and the child process (27) which was created
by that driver:
fs0:> Disconnect 23 27
Example 3: Disconnects the UEFI driver represented by handle 29 The UEFI driver on handle 29
produced a child (32) and is managing a device (44), which has a device path associated with it. In
order to disconnect the driver, the child and the device path managed by that driver are destroyed
along with stopping the driver.
fs0:> Disconnect 29 32 44
31.3.5.3 Reconnect

Command Description
Drivers
Devices
DevT ree
Dh -d
Lists all the UEFI drivers that follow the UEFI driver model. It uses the GetDriverName()
service of the Component Name protocols to retrieve the human-readable name of
each UEFI driver if it is available. It also shows the file path from which the UEFI
driver was loaded. As UEFI drivers are loaded with the Load command, they appear
in the list of drivers produced by the Drivers command. The Drivers command can
also show the name of the UEFI driver in different languages. The code below shows
the following examples of the Drivers command:
Example 1: Shows the Drivers command being used to list the UEFI drivers in the
default language.
fs0:> Drivers
Example 2: Shows the driver names in Spanish.
fs0:> Drivers -lsp
Lists all the devices that are being managed or produced by UEFI drivers that follow
the UEFI driver model. This command uses the GetControllerName() service of the
Component Name protocols to retrieve the human-readable name of each device
that is being managed or produced by UEFI drivers. If a human-readable name is not
available, then the EFI device path is used.
Similar to the Devices command. Lists all the devices being managed by UEFI drivers
that follow the UEFI driver model. This command uses the GetControllerName() service
of the Component Name Protocols to retrieve the human-readable name of each
device that is being managed or produced by UEFI drivers. If the human-readable
name is not available, then the EFI device path is used. This command also visually
shows the parent/child relationships between all of the devices by displaying them in
a tree structure. The lower a device is in the tree of devices, the more the device
name is indented. The code below shows the following examples of the DevTree
command:
Example 1: Displays the device tree with the device names in the default language.
fs0:> DevTree
Example 2: Displays the device tree with the device names in Spanish.
fs0:> DevTree -lsp
Example 3: Displays the device tree with the device names shown as EFI device
paths.
fs0:> DevTree -d
Provides a more detailed view of a single driver or a single device than the Drivers ,
Devices , and DevTree commands. If a driver binding handle is used with the Dh -d
command, then a detailed description of that UEFI driver is provided along with the
devices that the driver is managing and the child devices that the driver has
produced. If a device handle is used with the Dh -d command, then a detailed
description of that device is provided along with the drivers that are managing that
device, that device's parent controllers, and the device's child controllers. If the Dh -
d command is used without any parameters, then detailed information on all of the
drivers and devices is displayed. The code below shows the following examples of
the Dh -d command:
Example 1: Displays the details on the UEFI driver on handle 27.
fs0:> Dh -d 27
Example 2: Displays the details for the device on handle 23.
fs0:> Dh -d 23
Example 3: Shows details on all the drivers and devices in the system.
fs0:> Dh -d
OpenInfo
Provides detailed information on a device handle managed by one or more UEFI
drivers that follow the UEFI driver model. The OpenInfo command displays each
protocol interface installed on the device handle, and the list of agents that have
opened that protocol interface with the OpenProtocol() Boot Service.

31.3.6 Driver and Device Information
This command lists all the devices that are being managed or produced by UEFI drivers that follow the
UEFI driver model. This command uses the GetControllerName() service of the Component Name protocols
to retrieve the human-readable name of each device that is being managed or produced by UEFI
drivers. If a human-readable name is not available, then the EFI device path is used.
For Component Name: use the 3-letter language localiz ation
For Component Name2: use the 2x3-letter language localiz ation
The code below shows the following examples of the Devices command. The -l switch specifies the
localiz ed language.
Example 1: Shows the Devices command being used to list the UEFI drivers in the default language.
fs0:> Devices
Example 2: Shows the device names in Spanish.
fs0:> Devices -lspa fs0:> Devices -lsp
This command is backwards compatible. If the system supports both the Component Name Protocol and
the Component Name2 Protocol, the driver can produce both protocols. If the system supports only 2-
letter localiz ations, an error is generated if at attempt is made to enter the 2-leter localiz ation.
31.3.6.2 OpenInfo command
This command provides detailed information on a device handle that is being managed by one or more
UEFI drivers that follow the UEFI driver model. The OpenInfo command displays each protocol interface
installed on the device handle, and the list of agents that have opened that protocol interface with the
OpenProtocol() Boot Service.
This command may be used to display information for devices or drivers.
Example 1: The following example shows the OpenInfo command being used to display the list of
protocol interfaces on device handle 23 along with the list of agents that have opened those
protocol interfaces.
fs0:> OpenInfo 23
Example 2: The following example shows the OpenInfo command being used to display the list of
devices and/or child processes being managed by a driver.
fs0:> OpenInfo 15
Example 3: The OpenInfo command may be used along with the Connect , Disconnect , and Reconnect
commands to verify that a UEFI driver is opening and closing protocol interfaces correctly . For

31.4 Debugging code statements
31.4 Debugging code statements
A UEFI Driver may be implemented to support both a debug (check) build and a production build. The
debug build includes code that helps debug a UEFI Driver that is not included in normal production
builds. UEFI Driver sources are typically implemented with all the debug build statements included. The
DSC file used to build the UEFI Driver with the EDK II build tools contains statements to select a debug
build or a production build with no source changes to the UEFI Driver.
The EDK II library class called DebugLib provides macros that can be used to insert debug code into a
checked build. This debug code can greatly reduce the amount of time it takes to root cause a bug.
These macros are typically enabled only for debug builds and disabled in production builds so as to not
take up any executable space. The macros available through the DebugLib include:
ASSERT ( Expression )
ASSERT
EFI
_
_
ERROR ( Status )
ASSERT

DEBUG (( ErrorLevel, Format,. . ))

DEBUG
CODE
_
_
END ()
DEBUG
_
CODE ( Expression )
DEBUG
CLEAR
_
_
MEMORY ( Address, Length )
CR ( R ecord, TYPE, Field, Signature )
These macros are described in details in the MdePkg documentation available from
<http://www> .tianocore.org. The ErrorLevel parameter passed into the DEBUG() macro allows a UEFI driver
to assign a different error level to each debug message, which allows debug messages to be filtered.
The DSC files required to build a UEFI Driver can be used to set the ErrorLevel filter mask. The UEFI Shell
also supports the Err command that allows the user to set the error level filter mask.
TIP: Use a serial port as a standard error device during debug. This a terminal emulator to be used to
log debug messages to a file.
The table below contains the list of error levels that are supported in the UEFI Shell. Other levels are
usable, but not defined for a specific area.

NDEBUG is defined when a UEFI Driver is built, then all the DebugLib macros used by a UEFI Driver
are removed. This provides a smaller executable, but all debug log messages, assert condition checks,
and debug code are removed from the UEFI Driver that is produced by the EDK II build. The example
below shows the addition of a [BuildOptions] section to the DSC files from Chapter 30. It forces
MDEPKG
_
NDEBUG to be defined for RELEASE builds, which means all the DebugLib macros are disabled when the
-b RELEASE flag is used when building a UEFI Driver.

31.4.1.2 DebugLib Library Instances
The MdePkg provides 4 different implementations of the DebugLib library class. These are:
MdePkg/Library/BaseDebugLibNull/BaseDebugLibNull.inf
MdePkg/Library/BaseDebugLibConOut/BaseDebugLibConOut.inf
MdePkg/Library/BaseDebugLibStdErr/BaseDebugLibStdErr.inf
MdePkg/Library/BaseDebugLibSerialPort/BaseDebugLibSerialPort.inf BaseDebugLibNull is an implementation of the
DebugLib with empty worker functions. This means the DebugLib macros are mapped to empty worker
functions, so if the library instances is used by a UEFI Driver, no debug log messages, assert
condition checks, or debug code are active. Using this library mapping is not as small as using
MDEPKG
_
NDEBUG , but switching to this library mapping does not require a rebuild of the UEFI Driver
sources.
BaseDebugLibStdErr is the recommended library instance for UEFI drivers that are being debugged and is
the library that is used in the example DSC file in Chapter 30. This sends all messages to the Standard
Error console in the UEFI System T able. If there is no output, then the likely cause is that the Standard
Error device is not configured. Use the platform setup to configure the Standard Error.
BaseDebugLibConOut may be used as a substitute for BaseDebugLibStdErr when it is not possible to get the
Standard Error console configured. This sends all messages to the Standard Output console in the UEFI
System T able. This mixes debug messages with the normal console activity, so the display may be
difficult to read, and since most UEFI consoles do not support scroll up operations, it may be difficult to
see the messages when many are displayed.
BaseDebugLibSerialPort is not a UEFI conformant DebugLib. It directly accesses serial port hardware through
a SerialPortLib library instance. This can be useful when debugging UEFI Drivers that execute before UEFI
consoles are initializ ed, such as UEFI Drivers that are loaded and executed from a PCI Option ROM. When

this library instance is used, the UEFI Driver writer must know that there is a serial port available on the
target platform under test and must configure a SerialPortLib with for the attributes of the specific serial
port that is to be used.
31.4.1.3 DebugLib Platform Configuration Database Settings
The MdePkg library class DebugLib uses several Platform Configuration Database (PCD) setting to control
the behavior of the DebugLib macros. The token names for these PCD settings are as follows:
gEfiMdePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdDebugPropertyMask
gEfiMdePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdDebugPrintErrorLevel
gEfiMdePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdDebugClearMemoryValue
PcdDebugPropertyMask provides fine grain control over the macros provided by the DebugLib . The previous two
sections discuss how to disable the entire DebugLib and how to select different DebugLib library
instances. PcdDebugPropertryMask is a bit mask that allows individual DebugLib macro types to be enabled or
disabled. The example below shows the bitmask definitions. 0x01 enables ASSERT() macros. 0x02
enables DEBUG() macros. 0x04 enables the 3 DEBUG
_
CODE() macros. 0x08 enables the
DEBUG
CLEAR
_
_
MEMORY() macro. 0x10 and 0x20 control the behavior of the ASSERT() macro if the assert
condition evaluates to FALSE . 0x10 causes a CPU breakpoint to be generated, which is useful if a source
level debugger is being used, and 0x20 causes the CPU to enter an infinite loop so execution of the
UEFI Driver stops.

are currently enabled. The debug print error levels are shown in the Error Levels table above. Any
combination of the values can be set in the bitmask. If a bit is set, then DEBUG() macros with that same
ErrorLevel bit set are printed.
PcdDebugClearMemoryValue provides the 8-bit byte value to use when
DEBUG
CLEAR
_
_
MEMORY() macros are used. This value is typically set to 0x00 , but it is usually a good idea to try
a few different values to make sure code is not improperly using buffer contents that have been
cleared.
The following example shows the addition of a [PcdsFixedAtBuild] section to the DSC files from Chapter 30.
It sets PcdDebugPropertyMask so DEBUG() , ASSERT() , and DEBUG
_
CODE() macros are enabled and a breakpoint is
generated when an ASSERT() is triggered. It also sets the PcdDebugPrintErrorLevel at a fairly high verbosity
level with DEBUG
_
ERROR , DEBUG

31.5 POST codes
31.5 POST codes
If a UEFI driver is being developed that cannot make use of the DEBUG() and ASSERT() macros, then a
different mechanism must be used to help in the debugging process. Under these conditions, it is
usually sufficient to send a small amount of output to a device to indicate what portions of a UEFI driver
have executed and where error conditions have been detected.
A few possibilities are presented in this discussion, but many others are possible depending on the
devices that may be available on a specific platform. The first possibility is to use a POST card. Another
is to use a text-mode VGA frame buffer.
It is important to note that mechanisms are useful during driver development and debug, but they
should never be present in production versions of UEFI drivers because these types of devices are not
present on all platforms and accessing these devices may cause unexpected behavior on platforms
that do not include those devices.

31.5.1 POST Card Debug
31.5.1 POST Card Debug
A POST card is an add-in card that displays the hex value of an 8-bit I/O write cycle to address 0x80
Some POST cards support more than 8-bits and use additional I/O port addresses such as 0x81 The EDK
II MdePkg provides a library class called PostCodeLib that includes the POST
_
CODE() macro that may be used
to abstract access to a POST card. When a UEFI Driver is built, it can be configured in the DSC file to
map the PostCodeLib class to the MdePkg/Library/BasePostCodeLibPort80 instance that performs 8-bit writes to I/O
port 0x80 . If a platform has the equivalent POST card functionality, but it is not located at I/O port 0x80 ,
an alternate implementation of the PostCodeLib instance can be provided that allows a UEFI Driver to
send POST code values to the alternate POST card device without any source code changes to the UEFI
Driver itself . This example shows an example usage of the POST
_
CODE() macro to send POST code values
of 0x10 and 0x11 as a UEFI Driver enters and leaves the driver entry point.

The PostCodeLib uses PCDs to enable and disable the POST

CODE()
macros can be enabled during UEFI Driver development and debug when a platform with a POST card is
being used, and can be easily disabled for production builds of UEFI Drivers. The example below

chapter covers how to use the tools provided with the EDK II to convert one or more UEFI Drivers in
PE/COFF image formats into a single PCI Option ROM image that may be included with a PCI add-in card.
When a PCI add-in card is installed into a target platform, the PCI Option ROM contents are discovered
by the PCI Bus Driver and UEFI Drivers are loaded and executed automatically . No additional platform
configuration should be required. Some platforms may provide setup options to enable/disable specific
PCI slots or enable/disable the loading of PCI Option ROMs. If a UEFI Driver stored in a PCI Option ROM is
not being loaded and executed, then check the platform firmware configuration screens.

32.3 EFI System Partition
32.3 EFI System Partition
A device manufacturer that produces UEFI Drivers for their devices may choose to have their UEFI
Drivers installed onto an EFI System Partition on a target platform. This method may be selected for UEFI
Drivers that cannot be distributed using the two methods described above. It may also be a convenient
method for UEFI Driver updates to be distributed and installed onto target platforms. See the UEFI
Specification for details on EFI System Partitions and <http://www> .uefi.org for details on how device
manufacturers can reserve a subdirectory name for use on EFI System Partitions.
Note: There is no requirement for UEFI conformant platform firmware implementations to load UEFI
Drivers from EFI System Partitions. The capability is defined by the UEFI Specification but there is no
requirement that all platforms implement this capability .
Since this method depends on being able to access the EFI System Partition, the UEFI Driver that is to
be installed on the EFI System Partition must not be required to access the EFI System Partition itself,
either directly or indirectly . For example, a UEFI Driver for a SCSI Host Controller cannot be installed on
an EFI System Partition of a mass storage device attached to that same SCSI Host Controller. However, if
the SCSI Host Controller is a PCI add-in card with a UEFI Driver in a PCI Option ROM or the UEFI Driver for
the SCSI Host Controller is integrated in the platform firmware, it may be possible to install an update to
the UEFI Driver for the SCSI Host Controller in an EFI System Partition on one of the mass storage
devices attached to that SCSI Host Controller as long as the UEFI Driver in the PCI Option ROM or the
platform firmware is functional enough to load the updated UEFI Driver from the EFI System Partition.
There are a few steps that must be performed in order for a UEFI Driver to be installed onto an EFI
System Partition and for that UEFI Driver to be automatically loaded and executed each time the target
platform is booted.

1. The UEFI Driver must be copied onto a mass storage device that contains an EFI System Partition.
This may require a custom UEFI Application to perform this transfer, or utilities such as 1 the UEFI
Shell and UEFI Shell scripts may be used to install a UEFI Driver into a device specific directory .
2. Update the Driver#### and DriverOrder UEFI variables so the UEFI Driver installed on the EFI System
Partition is automatically loaded and executed on every boot. These variables can be updated from
a custom UEFI Application, or OEM setup screens if this option is exposed.
Tip: Use the UEFI Shell drivers command to view the set of UEFI Drivers that have been loaded and
executed to verify that a UEFI Driver that has been installed and configured to load from EFI System
Partition has actually been loaded and executed by the platform firmware.

Appendix A EDK II File T emplates
This discussion contains templates and guidelines for creating files for protocols, GUIDs, EDK II Library
Classes, and UEFI drivers in EDK II packages. The naming conventions for the driver entry point and the
functions exported by a driver that are presented here guarantee that a unique name is produced for
every function, which aides in call stack analysis when root-causing driver issues. The Doxygen style
function header comment blocks have been removed the file templates shown in this appendix to
highlight the source code elements required to build a UEFI Driver. The function headers comments
blocks can be added by coping them from the EDK II MdePkg protocol include files located in the
MdePkg/Include/Protocol/ directory .

A.1 UEFI Driver T emplate
A.1 UEFI Driver T emplate
UEFI driver sources are typically placed in a EDK II package. There are no restrictions on the directory
structure within an EDK II package. A common convention for UEFI Drivers related to industry standard
busses is to place the UEFI Driver in a directory path the such as
/<<PackageName>>/Bus/<<BUSTYPE>>/<<DriverName>> . The directory structure for a single UEFI Driver does not have to
be flat. Multiple closely related UEFI Drivers may be placed in subdirectories. The directory name for a
UEFI driver is typically of the form <<DriverName>> . For example, the USB keyboard driver in the MdeModulePkg
is located in the directory \MdeModulePkg\Bus\Usb\UsbKb .
Simple UEFI drivers typically have the following three files in their driver directory :
<<DriverName>>.inf
<<DriverName>>.h
<<DriverName>>.c
It is possible to reduce the number of files down to just <<DriverName>> .inf and <<DriverName>> .c. However, if
the complexity of the UEFI Driver increases over time where a splitting out a second .c file makes sense,
then a common .h file is usually required. If a UEFI Driver is implemented with a common .h file from the
beginning, then additional .c file can be added without have to reorganiz e the other source files. The
<<DriverName>> .inf file describes the information the EDK II build system required to build UEFI Driver into a
UEFI conformant executable image. This includes elements such as source filenames, EDK II package
dependencies, libraries that are used, Protocols that are produced/consumed, and GUIDs that are
used.
The <<DriverName>> .h file includes the standard UEFI include file, include files for libraries that the UEFI
Driver uses, and include files for protocols or GUIDs that the UEFI Driver either produces or consumes.
In addition, the <<DriverName>> .h file may contain the function prototypes for the public APIs that are
produced by the UEFI Driver and declarations for #defines and data structures that are internal to the
UEFI Driver implementation.
The <<DriverName>> .c file contains the driver entry point. If a UEFI driver produces the Driver Binding
Protocol, then the <<DriverName>> .c file typically contains the Supported(), Start(), and Stop() services.
The <<DriverName>> .c file may also contain the services for other protocol(s) that the UEFI driver produces.
Complex UEFI drivers that produce more than one protocol may be broken up into multiple source files.
The natural organiz ation is to place the implementation of each protocol that is produced in a separate
file of the form <<ProtocolName>>.c or <<DriverName>><<ProtocolName>>.c . For example, the disk I/O driver produces
the Driver Binding Protocol, the Disk I/O Protocol, the Component Name Protocol, and the Component
Name2 Protocol. The DiskIo.c file contains the Driver Binding Protocol and Disk I/O Protocol
implementations. The ComponentName.c file contains the implementation of the Component Name Protocol
and the Component Name2 Protocol.
A.1.1 <<DriverName>>.inf File for a UEFI Driver
A UEFI Driver module information file typically consists of the following elements. The following example
shows a template of an INF file with these same elements.
[Defines] section that declares a name for GUID for the UEFI Driver along with the name of the
function that is the entry point to the UEFI Driver.
[Sources] section with the list of .c and .h files required to build the UEFI Driver.

Driver may produce. The functions from the various protocols that a UEFI driver may produce are
discussed in later sections. There are many optional UEFI Driver features that are not shown in this
specific template. Each of those optional features are discussed in earlier chapters along with details
on how to add each of those optional features to a UEFI Driver.

A.1.5 <<ProtocolName>>.c File
More complex UEFI drivers may break the implementation into several source files. The natural boundary
is to implement one protocol per file.
A UEFI Driver protocol source file contains:
# include statement for <<DriverName>>.h .
Global variable declaration. This declaration applies only to protocols such as the Component Name
Protocols and Driver Diagnostics Protocols. Protocols that produce I/O services should never be
declared as a global variable. Instead, they are declared in the private context structure that is
dynamically allocated in the Start() function (see Chapter 8 of this guide).
Implementation of the APIs from the produced protocols.
The template in the example below shows the main source file for a protocol produced by a UEFI driver.
This template contains empty protocol function implementations. The remaining sections of this
appendix shows template files for all the optional UEFI Driver protocols.

This section contains templates for the extending the contents of an EDK II package. This is not a
common operation, but some UEFI Driver implementations may choose to define new protocols, new
GUIDs, or new library classes. This section also covers how to include protocols, GUIDs, and library
classes in a UEFI Driver.

A.5.1 Protocol File T emplate
A.5.1 Protocol File T emplate
The .h files for protocols are placed in the include directories of EDK II packages. The typical path to a
protocol .h file is <<PackageName>>/Include/Protocol/<<ProtocolName>>.h . For example, all the protocols defined in
the UEFI Specification can be found in the EDK II MdePkg in /MdePkg/Include/Protocol . When a new protocol is
defined and added to an include directory of an EDK II package, the protocol must also be added to the
[Protocols] section of a package's .dec file. The .dec file is where the C variable name for the protocol is
declared and mapped to GUID value for the protocol. Defining a new protocol is not commonly required
when implementing a new UEFI Driver. If a UEFI Driver implementation does require a new protocol
definition, then the new protocol is usually added to the same EDK II package that contains the UEFI
Driver implementation.
The example below shows a template for adding a new protocol to the [Protocols] section of an EDK II
package .dec file. Example A-26 shows the template for the .h files for protocols placed in the include
directory of an EDK II package.

A.5.2 GUID File T emplate
A.5.2 GUID File T emplate
GUIDs and their associated data structures are declared just like protocols. The only difference is that
GUIDs are typically placed in a different subdirectory of an EDK II package. The typical path to a protocol
.h file is <<PackageName>>/Include/Guid/<<GuidName>>.h . For example, all the GUIDs defined in the UEFI Specification
can be found in the EDK II MdePg in /MdePkg/Include/Guid. When a new GUID is defined and added to an
include directory of an EDK II package, the GUID must also be added to the [Guids] section of a
package's .dec file. The .dec file is where the C variable name for the GUID is declared and mapped to
GUID value for the protocol. Defining a new GUID is not commonly required when implementing a new
UEFI Driver. If a UEFI Driver implementation does require a new GUID definition, then the new GUID is
usually added to the same EDK II package that contains the UEFI Driver implementation.
The following example shows a template for adding a new GUID to the [Guids] section of an EDK II
package .dec file. Following that, Example A-29 shows the template for the .h files for GUIDs placed in
the include directory of an EDK II package.

EDK II Driver W riter's Guide for UEFI 2.3.1[DRAFT]
A.5.3 Library Class File T emplate
A.5.3 Library Class File T emplate
Library Classes and their associated functions, defines, and data structures are declared very similar to
protocols and GUIDs. The difference is that Library Classes are typically placed in a different
subdirectory of an EDK II package. The typical path to a library .h file is
<<PackageName>>/Include/Library/<<LibraryName>>.h . For example, all the libraries classes defined by the MdePkg
can be found in the EDK II /MdePkg/Include/Library . When a new library class is defined and added to an
include directory of an EDK II package, the library class must also be added to the [LibraryClasses]
section of a package's .dec file. The .dec file is where the mapping between the name of the library
class and the path to the include file for the library class is declared. Defining a new library class is not
commonly required when implementing a new UEFI Driver. If a UEFI Driver implementation does require a
new library class, then the new library class is usually added to the same EDK II package that contains
the UEFI Driver implementation.
Example A-30 shows a template for adding a new library class to the [LibraryClasses] section of an EDK II
package .dec file. Following that, Example A-31 shows the template for the .h files for a library class
placed in the include directory of an EDK II package. All public functions provided by a library class must
use the EFIAPI calling convention. The return type for a library class function is not required to be
EFI
STATUS . EFI

EDK II Driver W riter's Guide for UEFI 2.3.1[DRAFT]
A.5.4 Including Protocols, GUIDs, and Library Classes
A.5.4 Including Protocols, GUIDs, and Library Classes
A UEFI Driver that produces or consumes a protocol or GUID must include the protocol or GUID
definitions using #include statements and also declare the usage of those Protocols or GUIDs in the
[Protocols] and [Guids] sections of the INF file for the UEFI Driver. A UEFI Driver that uses defines,
structures, unions, or functions from a library class must include the those definitions using an #include
statement.
The #include statements use paths in EDK II packages to the .h files for the required protocols or GUIDs
or library classes. The include paths that an EDK II package supports are declared in the [Includes]
section of an EDK II package. An EDK II package typically uses an include directory called Include and
use subdirectories called
Protocol and Guid and Library for .h files. The example below shows some example #include statements
for a UEFI Driver that uses protocols and GUIDs and library classes from the MdePkg . The MdePkg contains
all the protocols and GUIDs defined in the UEFI Specification along with a number of library classes that
are very useful to UEFI Drivers. The include file Uefi.h pulls in all the standard definitions from the UEFI
Specification. This file must be included before any other include files. This next three include
statements pull in the Block I/O Protocol, the Driver Binding Protocol, and the Component Name 2
Protocol. The next 2 include statements pull in the definitions for the UEFI Global V ariable GUID and the
GUID associated with the SMBIOS table that may be registered in the UEFI System T able. The last set of
include statements pull in the definitions from a number of library classes that are commonly used by
UEFI Drivers.
Example A-32-Protocol, GUID, and Library Class include statements
# include <Uefi.h>
# include <Protocol/DriverBinding.h>
# include <Protocol/ComponentName2.h>
# include <Protocol/BlockIo.h>
# include <Guid/GlobalVariable.h>
# include <Guid/Smbios.h>
# include <Library/UefiBootServicesTableLib.h>
# include <Library/MemoryAllocationLib.h>
# include <Library/BaseMemoryLib.h>
# include <Library/BaseLib.h>
# include <Library/UefiLib.h>
# include <Library/DebugLib.h>
Example A-33, below, shows a portion of an INF file for the same UEFI Driver that requires the protocols
and GUIDs included in Example A-32 above. A UEFI Driver must declare the Protocols, GUIDs, and Library
Classes the UEFI Driver uses in the INF file. The comment blocks associated with each Protocol and GUID
and optional, but they describe how each Protocol and GUID is used by the UEFI Driver. This specific
example shows that this UEFI Driver produces the Driver Binding Protocol and the Component Name
Protocol, and it consumes the Block I/O Protocol in the Start() function of the Driver Binding Protocol. It
also shows that UEFI Global V ariable GUID is used to access the variable called ConIn and that the
SMBIOS T able GUID is used to lookup the SMBIOS T able in the UEFI System T able.

Appendix B EDK II Sample Drivers
This appendix lists sample UEFI Drivers in the EDK II open source project along with their UEFI Driver
related properties. This is not an exhaustive list of UEFI Drivers available from the EDK II open source
project. Instead, a set of UEFI Drivers that provide examples of each major UEFI Driver feature this guide
describes are listed. This appendix may be used to review UEFI Driver implementations that implement a
specific UEFI Driver feature. Or it may be used to find an example UEFI Driver with a feature set that
closely matches the features required for a new UEFI Driver so an existing driver can be cloned as a
starting point.
